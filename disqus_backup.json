This was a mistake, because I didn't account for the thickness of the carpeting that covered it, and I ended up never making the planned lid for the console. In reality, it should be narrow enough to fit between the arm rests taking into account the thickness of the carpet on both sides, and allowing a little extra space so it's not rubbing on them. I also ended up having to build up the sides of the middle and front portions quite a bit, in order to fit standard console panels (however wide they are, I don't remember). Looking back, I could've made the whole thing a couple inches narrower and it would've worked much better with the seats and also not had as wide an area on either side of the equipment panels.<br>* The height of the rear box was supposed to be just below the bottom of the arm rests.<br>* The height of the front \"hump\" by the dash was designed so that the cupholders in the dash could still pull out, and so that I could *barely* access the in-dash 12v outlet (not that I needed to; I ended up putting a 4x 12v outlet box on the side of the console)<br>* To come up with the dimensions and angles for the bottom (note there's a large flat part, a rise near the front of the bottom, and also a dip down near the back of the bottom) I removed the factory console and then used various lengths of wood / straight edge pressed down against the floor to figure out what the actual profile of the transmission hump was. Once I had a pretty good idea, I transferred the profile to the edge of a single piece of plywood, pressed it down against the trans hump, and adjusted as needed until I had something that fit well. I think I may have also used various types of angle and contour finders when coming up with the profile.<br>* The overall shape of the front profile - tip up for the trans hump, vertical flat portion, tip back to fit under the dash, horizontal flat at the top to fit under the pull-out cup holders - is largely based on me leaning into the truck with a piece of foam board and a utility knife, and just shaving off pieces until I found something that fit nicely.<br>* The depth of the front and middle sections was mostly based on the depth of the equipment that I wanted to mount in it, plus the wires/cables coming out the backs. I knew, for example, that my switch box would fit in the middle area but my scanner (and future radio that was added) had to go in the angled front area with more clearance behind the panels.</p><p>My biggest regret with this whole build was the carpeting that I used. Pretty much everyone who saw this said something along the lines of \"that looks great, why'd you ruin it with that awful carpeting?\". While the sample square that I got seemed like it was pretty close to the factory original, the actual carpet that I received was *much* thicker with a *much* higher pile. It looked really weird and out of place. It also had a really heavy backing, which made it essentially impossible to bend around the corners of the plywood. I'm pretty sure that the thinner material they make for subwoofer enclosures would have worked out much better.</p><p>-Jason</p>", "isSpam": false, "isHighlighted": false, "author": {"username": "jasonantman", "about": "Systems engineer at CMGdigital, monitoring/automation nut, Linux and Android user, husband, ceaseless tinkerer.", "name": "Jason Antman", "disable3rdPartyTrackers": false, "isPowerContributor": false, "isAnonymous": false, "profileUrl": "https://disqus.com/by/jasonantman/", "url": "http://blog.jasonantman.com", "location": "Conyers, GA", "isPrivate": false, "signedUrl": "http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.jasonantman.com&key=sqQluY2gTYcq4tEAiJPq5g", "isPrimary": true, "joinedAt": "2014-02-26T03:20:20", "id": "96405480", "avatar": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jasonantman.jpg", "xlarge": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jasonantman.jpg", "cache": "https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9640/5480/avatar200.jpg?1640526431"}, "cache": "https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9640/5480/avatar92.jpg?1640526431", "large": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jasonantman.jpg", "cache": "https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9640/5480/avatar92.jpg?1640526431"}, "small": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/jasonantman.jpg", "cache": "https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9640/5480/avatar32.jpg?1640526431"}, "isCustom": true}}, "media": [], "id": "5293719118", "isDeletedByAuthor": false, "isDeleted": false, "parent": 5293407992, "isApproved": true, "isNewUserNeedsApproval": false, "isFlagged": false, "raw_message": "Douglas,\nUnfortunately this blog post seems to be the only thing left of either that console or the truck.

In reality, it should be narrow enough to fit between the arm rests taking into account the thickness of the carpet on both sides, and allowing a little extra space so it's not rubbing on them. I also ended up having to build up the sides of the middle and front portions quite a bit, in order to fit standard console panels (however wide they are, I don't remember). Looking back, I could've made the whole thing a couple inches narrower and it would've worked much better with the seats and also not had as wide an area on either side of the equipment panels.\n* The height of the rear box was supposed to be just below the bottom of the arm rests.\n* The height of the front \"hump\" by the dash was designed so that the cupholders in the dash could still pull out, and so that I could *barely* access the in-dash 12v outlet (not that I needed to; I ended up putting a 4x 12v outlet box on the side of the console)\n* To come up with the dimensions and angles for the bottom (note there's a large flat part, a rise near the front of the bottom, and also a dip down near the back of the bottom) I removed the factory console and then used various lengths of wood / straight edge pressed down against the floor to figure out what the actual profile of the transmission hump was. Once I had a pretty good idea, I transferred the profile to the edge of a single piece of plywood, pressed it down against the trans hump, and adjusted as needed until I had something that fit well. I think I may have also used various types of angle and contour finders when coming up with the profile.\n* The overall shape of the front profile - tip up for the trans hump, vertical flat portion, tip back to fit under the dash, horizontal flat at the top to fit under the pull-out cup holders - is largely based on me leaning into the truck with a piece of foam board and a utility knife, and just shaving off pieces until I found something that fit nicely.\n* The depth of the front and middle sections was mostly based on the depth of the equipment that I wanted to mount in it, plus the wires/cables coming out the backs. I knew, for example, that my switch box would fit in the middle area but my scanner (and future radio that was added) had to go in the angled front area with more clearance behind the panels.\n\nMy biggest regret with this whole build was the carpeting that I used. Pretty much everyone who saw this said something along the lines of \"that looks great, why'd you ruin it with that awful carpeting?\". While the sample square that I got seemed like it was pretty close to the factory original, the actual carpet that I received was *much* thicker with a *much* higher pile. It looked really weird and out of place. It also had a really heavy backing, which made it essentially impossible to bend around the corners of the plywood. I'm pretty sure that the thinner material they make for subwoofer enclosures would have worked out much better.\n\n-Jason", "isAtFlagLimit": false, "canVote": false, "forum": "jantman", "thread": "2346193675", "createdAt": "2021-03-06T13:32:30", "points": 0, "moderationLabels": [], "isEdited": false, "sb": false}, {"editableUntil": "2021-03-13T03:07:42", "dislikes": 0, "numReports": 0, "likes": 0, "message": "<p>Do you have dimensions for this box that you are willing to share?</p>", "isSpam": false, "isHighlighted": false, "author": {"username": "douglaslake", "about": "", "name": "Douglas Lake", "disable3rdPartyTrackers": false, "isPowerContributor": false, "isAnonymous": false, "profileUrl": "https://disqus.com/by/douglaslake/", "url": "", "location": "", "isPrivate": false, "signedUrl": "", "isPrimary": true, "joinedAt": "2017-11-05T17:20:22", "id": "270313838", "avatar": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/douglaslake.jpg", "xlarge": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/douglaslake.jpg", "cache": "//a.disquscdn.com/1646250187/images/noavatar128.png"}, "cache": "//a.disquscdn.com/1646250187/images/noavatar92.png", "large": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/douglaslake.jpg", "cache": "//a.disquscdn.com/1646250187/images/noavatar92.png"}, "small": {"permalink": "https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/douglaslake.jpg", "cache": "//a.disquscdn.com/1646250187/images/noavatar32.png"}, "isCustom": false}}, "media": [], "id": "5293407992", "isDeletedByAuthor": false, "isDeleted": false, "parent": 4888896697, "isApproved": true, "isNewUserNeedsApproval": false, "isFlagged": false, "raw_message": "Do you have dimensions for this box that you are willing to share?", "isAtFlagLimit": false, "canVote": false, "forum": "jantman", "thread": "2346193675", "createdAt": "2021-03-06T03:07:42", "points": 0, "moderationLabels": [], "isEdited": false, "sb": false}, {"editableUntil": "2021-01-15T15:40:41", "dislikes": 0, "numReports": 0, "likes": 0, "message": "<p>This is a best blog to troubleshoot your amcrest Camera.

I was impressed with the level of detail with success and failures and to the point...</p><p>So here is my story on my CCTV solution, Strong in Windows and new to Linux but really wanted to learn more about so in my voyage looking for a solution I could say I\u2019ve tested a few, some with success and many with failures. iSpy I was able to get running quick and easy but it kept giving me the blue screen of death. Tried multiple physical computers and virtual under VMware even with every OS available to me from XP to Server 2008. All the same.. So I began look in the Linux world, again being new most of the documentation lacked the necessary details needed to the products working (Open Source is not for the amateurs).</p><p>So I did focus on zoneminder, after a few failures I found a set of instructions under Ubuntu 16.04, <a href=\"https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoneminder.readthedocs.io%2Fen%2Fstable%2Finstallationguide%2Fubuntu.html%3ANaWkjE9Ud17Wxzx8j9OCaWH4pAQ&amp;cuid=2876283\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://zoneminder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installationguide/ubuntu.html\">https://zoneminder.readthed...</a><br>Presto, it\u2019s working\u2026 I had a mix of cameras from all over, I had them all blocked at the Firewall because we know what security risks are on IoT\u2026 So I thought maybe I can re-flash them using <a href=\"http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopenip.cam%3A7pNz6b0XRDAxaxS2sPw4myNFS2c&amp;cuid=2876283\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"openip.cam\">openip.cam</a>, well being a Linux amateur and maybe some ADHD it did not take long to kick that to the curb.</p><p>To keep this tread short, here is where I am today\u2026 Been playing with Raspberry Pi\u2019s for almost a year working different projects. A month ago I started working the Pi Cameras\u2026 Played most with raspivid and then VLC, both worked with limitations\u2026 Last weekend loaded motioneye and I was impressed with the simplicity of the install and some of the options available, so I decided to push the limits and loaded 4 pi cams and used a 5th B+ as the host for them all, well it started choking a bit\u2026 So I now use motioneye as the camera load (turn off everything possible), resolution 1280x768 @ 30FPS and use zoneminder for the server portion.</p><p>For me with 7 camera\u2019s loaded with motion eye and zoneminder (2% load) on a physical box DMZ\u2019ed I\u2019m pleased with the progress of my CCTV solution. Additionally I use the zmNinja for a mobile app and again very pleased. <br>My main concerns are security (does my camera have a back channel, not now), camera cost and the proprietary software like only works with our mobile app.</p><p>4 more Pi\u2019s on the way, hope to be here today\u2026 So I\u2019m running Pi Zero W, Camera\u2019s vary from 5MP with and without IR to learn more on the environments they will support.

I was impressed with the level of detail with success and failures and to the point... \n\nSo here is my story on my CCTV solution, Strong in Windows and new to Linux but really wanted to learn more about so in my voyage looking for a solution I could say I\u2019ve tested a few, some with success and many with failures. iSpy I was able to get running quick and easy but it kept giving me the blue screen of death. Tried multiple physical computers and virtual under VMware even with every OS available to me from XP to Server 2008. All the same.. So I began look in the Linux world, again being new most of the documentation lacked the necessary details needed to the products working (Open Source is not for the amateurs).\n\nSo I did focus on zoneminder, after a few failures I found a set of instructions under Ubuntu 16.04, https://zoneminder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installationguide/ubuntu.html\nPresto, it\u2019s working\u2026 I had a mix of cameras from all over, I had them all blocked at the Firewall because we know what security risks are on IoT\u2026 So I thought maybe I can re-flash them using openip.cam, well being a Linux amateur and maybe some ADHD it did not take long to kick that to the curb. \n\nTo keep this tread short, here is where I am today\u2026 Been playing with Raspberry Pi\u2019s for almost a year working different projects. A month ago I started working the Pi Cameras\u2026 Played most with raspivid and then VLC, both worked with limitations\u2026 Last weekend loaded motioneye and I was impressed with the simplicity of the install and some of the options available, so I decided to push the limits and loaded 4 pi cams and used a 5th B+ as the host for them all, well it started choking a bit\u2026 So I now use motioneye as the camera load (turn off everything possible), resolution 1280x768 @ 30FPS and use zoneminder for the server portion. \n\nFor me with 7 camera\u2019s loaded with motion eye and zoneminder (2% load) on a physical box DMZ\u2019ed I\u2019m pleased with the progress of my CCTV solution. Additionally I use the zmNinja for a mobile app and again very pleased. \nMy main concerns are security (does my camera have a back channel, not now), camera cost and the proprietary software like only works with our mobile app.  \n\n4 more Pi\u2019s on the way, hope to be here today\u2026 So I\u2019m running Pi Zero W, Camera\u2019s vary from 5MP with and without IR to learn more on the environments they will support. I have 2 8MP Pi camera\u2019s on the way. My Point, Pi Zero costs 35 for the kit, and about 25 for the camera, so for 50 bucks I get pretty good quality. \n\nThis weekend I\u2019m getting a 3 head LED security light, going to remove the center light and replace with a Pi Zero\u2026 So let\u2019s see how this comes out.

It's probably a bit of overkill just for SSH; it's intended to be a full \"secret management\" solution, i.e. authenticating users and machines and giving them (ACL'ed, leased, audited, time-limited) access to \"secrets\" that can be arbitrary strings or key/value pairs, as well as \"dynamic\" secrets (i.e. creating database users, IAM users, etc. on-demand and expiring them after a given amount of time, or revoking them on request).

I was working with the HubMax, which is just a standalone controller box with up to four door modules, each module having a lock and a keypad.
