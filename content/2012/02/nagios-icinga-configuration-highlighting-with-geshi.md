As you may know from former posts, this blog ([WordPress][]-powered) and
a few [MediaWiki][] sites that I have use the excellent PHP-based
[GeSHi][] syntax highlighter. Today I was writing [a post][] that
includes some Icinga (Nagios) configuration snippets. After a quick
search, I found a [Nagios language file for GeSHi][] on GitHub. Thanks
very much to [Albéric de Pertat (adepertat)][] for writing this and
providing it to the public.
