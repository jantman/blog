&lt;a href="/2009/02/truck-wiring-and-lighting-part-i/"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;#8217;d put so
much &lt;a href="/2009/02/custom-truck-console/"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago - 08:43 on Saturday, May 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2010 - I was involved in a
&amp;#8220;bit&amp;#8221; of an accident with my truck while driving down to my dad&amp;#8217;s place
in Hunterdon county. I was &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.017828,-74.217229&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;sll=41.018107,-74.218228&amp;amp;sspn=0.007026,0.016512&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.017834,-74.217217&amp;amp;spn=0.007026,0.016512&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;on 208
Northbound&lt;/a&gt;
in Franklin Lakes right across from the Colonial Rd intersection (maybe
8 minutes from home?), early in the morning. I really don&amp;#8217;t have any
desire to tell the &lt;em&gt;whole detailed&lt;/em&gt; story again, but bottom like: there
were three geese crossing the highway, and someone got the brilliant
idea to rapidly decelerate from 60 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPH&lt;/span&gt; to allow the birds to safely
cross. I still can&amp;#8217;t provide for the account of where every vehicle on
the road went, but there was a half-second of various drivers making
evasive maneuvers, me jamming on the brake and horn, and my truck having
a fast introduction to the ass-end of a box&amp;nbsp;truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily nobody was injured, though I did have neck pain for a day or two
after. The guy who decided to stop/cut left (in front of the box truck)
drove happily off into the sunrise, the guy in a blacked out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt; who had
been between the box truck and my vehicle (obscuring most of the truck
from my view) also, as far as I know, departed. Once I got the airbags
out of my way and the door kicked open, my former vehicle was on its way
to the body&amp;nbsp;shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, while I had an absolutely horrendous experience with
&lt;a href="http://www.geico.com"&gt;geico&lt;/a&gt; when this same vehicle was stolen a year
and a half ago, they were actually pretty good this time around. The
accident happened on a Sunday, I took Monday off of work to get a rental
car and deal with the claim (yeah, it turns out my policy didn&amp;#8217;t have
the rental coverage, much to my surprise&amp;#8230;) and the claims agent came
out Tuesday (less than 48 hours after the accident) to make an estimate.
He totaled the truck - the motor was even broken loose of all of the
mounts - and I had a check in my hand (minus the balance of the
financing) 12 days after the accident. So&amp;#8230; my experience with Geico
this time around was much better. I guess as long as there&amp;#8217;s a vehicle
for them to look at, they&amp;#8217;re happy. Though I&amp;#8217;m switching to Progressive
for the next&amp;nbsp;vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#8217;s the story. Assuming Enterprise car rental is playing nice,
I&amp;#8217;ll be picking up the truck I just bought tomorrow&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;

about disaster-related topics. Especially in the post-9/11 days.
Recently, I got an email asking me if I&amp;#8217;d seen the Department of
Homeland Security&amp;#8217;s disaster preparedness site,
&lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov"&gt;ready.gov&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d heard a bit about it, but hadn&amp;#8217;t
really looked around. The site&amp;#8217;s main premise is to educate people about
how to prepare for a disaster - &amp;#8220;get a kit&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;make a plan&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;be&amp;nbsp;informed&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site&amp;#8217;s own &lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/about/index.html"&gt;About
page&lt;/a&gt; states that it is
&amp;#8220;designed to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to
emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The goal of the
campaign is to get the public involved and ultimately to increase the
level of basic preparedness across the&amp;nbsp;nation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step on the site, &lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/getakit/index.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;Get a
Kit&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, includes a list
of supplies to have on hand as a basic disaster kit. The introduction to
the page&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to survive on your own after an emergency. This means
having your own food, water, and other supplies in sufficient quantity
to last for at least three days. Local officials and relief workers
will be on the scene after a disaster, but they cannot reach everyone
immediately. You could get help in hours, or it might take days. In
addition, basic services such as electricity, gas, water, sewage
treatment, and telephones may be cut off for days, or even a week or&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, I assumed this would be geared more towards urbanites, not
those of us in the suburbs or rural America (the latter generally being
more accustomed to self-sufficiency), so I adjusted my expectations
accordingly. At first glance, it seems to include most of the things
that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt; in me would want it&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food and&amp;nbsp;water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First aid&amp;nbsp;kit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrench or pliers to turn off gas&amp;nbsp;line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prescription&amp;nbsp;medications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleach (as a disinfectant and for water&amp;nbsp;purification)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire&amp;nbsp;extinguisher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I found a number of things obviously missing. Sure, some are
minor - matches but no mention of fuel, bleach but not even coffee
filters to remove particulate matter from water. I also find it comical
that so many years after the Cold War &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover"&gt;&amp;#8220;Duck and
Cover&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; approach to nuclear
safety, the government is now telling people to
&lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/makeaplan/shelter_in_place.html"&gt;Shelter-In-Place&lt;/a&gt;
in the event of a biological attack - by covering their doors and
windows with plastic&amp;nbsp;sheeting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by far the most egregious omission from the list - something learned
by man at least 5,000 years ago, and taught to every Boy Scout - is the
simplest tool: a knife. Yup, that&amp;#8217;s right, the Disaster Kit list doesn&amp;#8217;t
include &lt;strong&gt;any variety of cutting implement&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t know if whoever
wrote up the list is just scared of getting sued when little Bobby finds
the knife and kills himself, or whether they&amp;#8217;re really that stupid. But
I, for one, never leave my house without some variety of the oldest real
tool devised by man, and can&amp;#8217;t imagine anyone thrown into any sort of
&amp;#8220;survival&amp;#8221; situation without at least a rudimentary way to cut, scrape,
pry, etc. I&amp;#8217;d say that if I were without utilities or organized public
safety for &amp;#8220;at least three days&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;d sure want to be able to make
simple repairs, fashion simple tools, or perhaps cut&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another (albeit less important) note, there are still &lt;em&gt;many, many&lt;/em&gt;
Americans, not just in rural areas, who have a fireplace or wood stove.

playing around with Inkscape for quite a while, and coming up with the
dismal results seen in that post, I decided there has to be an easier
way. A little Googling turned up &lt;a href="http://www.wipeout44.com/video/misc/google_maps_large.asp"&gt;this video
tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on
how to print large scale maps from Google Maps. It turns out that the
Google Maps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; will honor almost any pixel resolution that it&amp;#8217;s passed.
The &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1146"&gt;Screengrab&lt;/a&gt;
add-on for Firefox has the wonderful capability of being able to capture
a screengrab of page content, at actual resolution, regardless of screen
resolution. So load up a 5000x5000 pixel Google Map, use the Screengrab
addon, and end up with a full 5000x5000 pixel image&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing this a bit, I decided to go the Google Maps route. This
also has a lot of other added bonuses - I can store my overlay data in
simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; files, add and remove layers on-the-fly, and also make it
available online (and, theoretically, to any Google Maps-equipped device
used by responders). This even opens up the possibility of using paper
maps as a last resort, and providing the Fire Department with live
hydrant maps on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;-enabled handheld devices and&amp;nbsp;phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quirks, however, may need some serious photoshopping (err, rather,
&lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;gimp&lt;/a&gt;ing) to&amp;nbsp;fix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With all of the background color, how will this look when&amp;nbsp;printed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I make the town borders easily defined? It would be a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;
    of raster editing to remove the background color of areas outside of&amp;nbsp;town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I overlay a grid for a street name&amp;nbsp;index?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to setup a large Google Map to develop with. I used
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and Monte Ohrt&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://www.phpinsider.com/php/code/GoogleMapAPI/"&gt;GoogleMapAPI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
wrapper class. It was simple enough to setup a big (3300x5100px) map,
zoom out in Firefox, and start adding some stuff. My examples and
development pages, if you want to take a peek at the code, are available
in &lt;a href="/GFX/googleMaps.tar.gz"&gt;googleMaps.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to draw a polygon for the outline of the town. I
found some very detailed information on how to get zip code boundary
lines on Matt Cutts&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/fun-with-zip-codes/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently,
he&amp;#8217;s a Google software engineer, heading up their webspam team. I
grabbed the files from the Census, as described, and came up with the
boundary for my zip code looking&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;

truck&lt;/a&gt;,
I was originally going to order the antennas and mounts from
&lt;a href="http://www.tessco.com/"&gt;Tessco&lt;/a&gt;, but I found that &lt;a href="http://www.theantennafarm.com"&gt;The Antenna
Farm&lt;/a&gt; in Montana had the best price on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IC&lt;/span&gt;-F5061, and also carried the antennas and mounts. I must first say
that there was a notice on the Antenna Farm web site that they had moved
to a new location a few days before I placed my order. I waited to place
my order until the web site stated that things were shipping&amp;nbsp;normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I placed my order, I added in the &amp;#8220;notes&amp;#8221; field that I would like
tracking numbers sent to me as soon as they were available, as I had
requested &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; shipping. I received an initial order confirmation. After
waiting a few days, I had received neither a confirmation that my card
was charged nor a tracking number. The order status on their web site
was still listed as &amp;#8220;processing&amp;#8221;. I called back four days after placing
my order, and it took five calls over two days to get anything other
than an answering machine. When I finally got through to John (the owner
and, as far as I can tell, sole employee), the voice quality of their
phone line was so poor I could hardly communicate. I got enough of his
end of the conversation to understand that I should email him, which I
did (for the second or third time). In the email, I stated that I was
having the equipment installed, so I really needed to know when it would
arrive in order to schedule an&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed the order early on a Monday morning. After numerous attempts to
make contact, and no change in the &amp;#8220;processing&amp;#8221; status on the web site,
I finally got an email back on Thursday afternoon stating that some of
the antenna mounts were out of stock, and part of the order would be
drop shipped from the distributor, and should be there the next day.
Still no mention of a tracking number, which I had requested numerous
times. I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a bit of selling on Ebay, and know how easy it is
to provide a customer with this information. He also stated that the
high frequency antenna mount for the WiFI antenna was out of stock at
the distributor as well, so he had them make up a more expensive one at
no extra&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop ship box arrived the next day, Friday. It contained the two
antennas (I ordered the WiFi antenna directly from L-Com) and two
antenna mounts - *one* of the Antenex &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB8X&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, and the high frequency
mount for the WiFi antenna. The WiFi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mount was &lt;em&gt;definitelty&lt;/em&gt; not the
one I ordered. I know John incurred extra cost in having them custom add
a connector, but it didn&amp;#8217;t look like any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mount I had ever seen (it
appeared to accept a pin in the center, as opposed to having a flat disc
to make&amp;nbsp;contact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, on Tuesday, the Icom radio arrived. It was as ordered,
but the second Antenex &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB8X&lt;/span&gt; was nowhere to be found. I did finally
receive a tracking number about 24 hours prior to&amp;nbsp;delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after I placed my order (with three day &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; shipping),
&lt;a href="http://kensautoelectric.com/"&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; managed to fit me in early in the
morning. I told him about the missing third antenna mount, and he agreed
to use one from his stock. Much to my dismay, when he dropped off the
truck, I learned that *neither* of the antenna mounts that arrived
were true &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mounts, and thus they were both&amp;nbsp;useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;m horribly disappointed with The Antenna Farm. The lack of
communication is appalling, regardless of whether they&amp;#8217;re having
telephone problems or not (and I find it hard to believe that this guy
doesn&amp;#8217;t have a cell phone, or can&amp;#8217;t setup something VoIP-based). The
online feedback on order status is nonexistent, and I might as well have
had it shipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USPS&lt;/span&gt;, because I only got one tracking number and that was
a mere day before delivery. One of three antenna mounts was never
received (though John did refund me the cost) and the other two were not
as specified. He clearly has no idea how to deal with someone who
actually has a timeframe - perhaps normal for someone who does most of
his business with hams and not public safety (I guess that&amp;#8217;s my fault
for choosing a bad vendor). When he found out that there would be delays
in fulfilling my order, John should have contacted me and asked me how I
wanted to proceed. The bulk of my order was drop shipped from Tessco,
who I&amp;#8217;ve done business with before and would have been more than happy
to order direct&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming kit for the F5061 that I ordered from The Antenna Farm,
which was listed as &amp;#8220;you buy the cable, we throw in the software&amp;#8221;,
arrived as a loose cable in the radio box and a home-burned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;, without
even any writing on it to say what it was, with a simple zip file of the
installer. I don&amp;#8217;t know what Icom&amp;#8217;s licensing agreement is, but I doubt
they&amp;#8217;d be happy about this, as the software isn&amp;#8217;t available on their web&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I was told by my installer that he stopped buying
from The Antenna Farm a few years ago due to endless&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="antennafarm"></category><category term="communications"></category><category term="EMS"></category><category term="radio"></category></entry><entry><title>Update on my F-250 - Icom mobile, antennas, strobes</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-14T00:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-14T00:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-07-14:/2009/07/update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a bit of work on my truck since my last update, and also have

emergency equipment stripped out - weird) I&amp;#8217;ve got to start from
scratch. Since I finished the console, I&amp;#8217;ve started work on redoing the
lighting. The first grueling step was to check continuity of the
existing wiring (what was left of it), strip out everything that didn&amp;#8217;t
work, and rehab what did. Then I did a few pulls, mainly a giant pull
from the console to under the hood of six 16-ga wires and three 12-ga,
along with a massive run of 6-ga welding cable direct from the battery
(with a circuit breaker) to the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve updated this with a scan of those dimensions at the end of the&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep this post relatively to the point (the original full story is
on &lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org"&gt;eLightbars.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb//topic401009.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb/post59822.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). My 2006 Ford F-250
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLT&lt;/span&gt; was stolen in September, 2008. It was recovered about a month
later, after Geico said they&amp;#8217;d pay out, and after I&amp;#8217;d bought another
vehicle. Anyway, it came back from the body shop about 2 months later,
and it was time to begin customizing it again. The main parts of the
project were wiring and installation and building a custom&amp;nbsp;console&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main inspiration was some of the custom consoles done by places like
&lt;a href="http://www.odysseyauto.com/"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, though I wanted something
carpeted (hopefully a close match to the factory interior). The main
idea I was working off of was this one from&amp;nbsp;Odyssey:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Odyssey Excursion console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/excurcon-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea was to have a replacement for the factory console which
would allow mounting of a radio, emergency lighting controls, and a few
other things while not sacrificing storage space. The specific
requirements that I came up with&amp;nbsp;included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount over the transmission hump more or less where the factory
    console is, forward to the&amp;nbsp;dash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow access to the pull-out cupholders in the dash and not impede
    access to any&amp;nbsp;controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasten to the floor using only the four factory console&amp;nbsp;bolts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow mounting of at least one radio, one switch box, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;scanner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio and switch box should be mounted using the &lt;a href="http://www.jottodesk.com/"&gt;Jotto
    Desk&lt;/a&gt; faceplates that I had from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVPI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The real clincher that prevented me from using a stock console:&lt;/em&gt; Have a large storage
    compartment comparable to the factory&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a set of rear&amp;nbsp;cupholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time over the course of three days or so measuring the
console area of the truck and drawing out my initial plan in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;
(specifically the demo version of &lt;a href="http://www.qcad.org/qcad.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QCAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for Linux - regrettably not Free software). Once I had the plans drawn
up and was satisfied that the angles and measurements were within
acceptable tolerance, I made a full-scale prototype out of foam core
board. With a little shaving of the corners, I managed to get a
relatively good form and transferred it to ½&amp;#8221; cabinet-grade luan
plywood. It was a bit difficult with only a jigsaw, but worked out
relatively well. While I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find any pictures of the foam
core, here are some of the wood form being assembled and the test fit in
the&amp;nbsp;truck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console2-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console1-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console3-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d originally been a bit worried about the structural integrity, but I
found that by clamping the corners, pre-drilling and securing them with
aggressive wood screws at approximately 1 screw per 1.5 inches along the
joints, the plywood held together&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing the fit and checking that the four factory bolt holes
lined up correctly (which they did, and also held the console quite
securely), I pulled it back out and started the process of carpeting it.
I bought 2 yards (76 x 72 inch) of color #8078 &amp;#8220;Dark Grey/Quartz&amp;#8221; plush
cut pile automotive carpet from
&lt;a href="http://www.stockinteriors.com/"&gt;StockInteriors.com&lt;/a&gt;, for about $80 with
shipping. It turns out that the color isn&amp;#8217;t an exact match to the
factory carpet (I got 6 sample squares from them and this was the
closest color) but it&amp;#8217;s a good medium between the carpet and&amp;nbsp;upholstery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for how to cover this wooden behemoth with carpet took quite a
few hours, and short of making it into a week-long job of sewing, I
decided to wrap the sides and back with one piece, folded over on the
bottom and top edges of the storage box, then use separate pieces for
the top of the console and the front (which would be adjacent to the
dash and mostly hidden from view). I started off with a plan to use &lt;a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/"&gt;3M
Super
90&lt;/a&gt;
spray adhesive, on the advice of an &lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
member. Unfortunately, I could only find &lt;a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/"&gt;Super
77&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to carpeting, I had to get the equipment mounting openings down to
about 8.5&amp;#8221; for the 8.75&amp;#8221; Jotto faceplates. I cut some excess luan
plywood down into 2&amp;#8221; wide strips and then cut them to length for the
openings, sandwiching about three together with &lt;a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=42"&gt;Liquid
Nails&lt;/a&gt; and
then mounted them vertically on the sides of the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpeting the console at 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; probably wasn&amp;#8217;t the best idea. I looked at
how the cut edges of the carpet would meet and the corners, and decided
I&amp;#8217;d need some sort of edge molding to make it look good - preferably
black powder coated aluminum, somewhere around ½&amp;#8221; legs. As such, I
decided to forgo most of the glue and stapled the carpet at the edges,
planning to cover it with molding. Ok, I lose a few points for that one.
The last thing to go on was the carpet on the front and top, which I
glued with Super 77 and also stapled on the front (where it can&amp;#8217;t be
seen). I cut X-shapes in the mounting areas and folded the carpet down,
stapling it to the inside of the console, and cut a slit in the front
for wiring. The glue didn&amp;#8217;t seem to hold on the narrow parts of the
top/mounting area, but once faceplates were screwed in it was fine. The
faceplates are just held in with screws into the vertical wood strips
placed on the sides of the&amp;nbsp;opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top view of the console, mounted in place, with the unfinished storage&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="top view of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0040_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipment mounting&amp;nbsp;area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="console equipment mounting area" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0041_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="view from drivers seat" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0042_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factory cupholders extended with just enough clearance to&amp;nbsp;work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="factory cupholders open, barely" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0045_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staples around the edges, intended to be covered with molding. They&amp;#8217;re
really not that visible unless you make a point of looking at them
(given their placement). Red handle is a 100A cutoff for the main
battery lead, with a removable&amp;nbsp;handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="staples around edges and battery cutoff switch" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0046_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The weekend after console fabrication, I started wiring. Here&amp;#8217;s the
relevant parts involving the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-finished console with equipment mounted. Front-to back,

nifty Jotto storage&amp;nbsp;tray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="equipment in mounted

&lt;img alt="rear of

&lt;p&gt;Still to be&amp;nbsp;done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the wiring and&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lining the storage box with something, probably toolbox drawer&amp;nbsp;liner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a cover/lid for the storage&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;

package for handling Electronic Patient Care Reports for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; (Emergency
Medical Services) agencies. There are a few popular packages around, but
most of them are web-based. In the event of a disaster - or even bad
storm - when Internet connectivity is minimal to non-existent, frankly,
you&amp;#8217;re up the creek without a paddle. There are also, to my knowledge,
no Free/Open-Source (or free of cost) packages available. This isn&amp;#8217;t
good, especially with many states and regions moving to standardized
PCRs with electronic submission. This is even worse for the thousands
(or more) of purely volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; organizations out there, who have
little to no&amp;nbsp;budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve started a project - &lt;a href="www.openepcr.org"&gt;openEPCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that, for me, this is a *big* undertaking. I figured that Java
is the best option, since it&amp;#8217;s available on almost all platforms,
robust, and frankly is very well accepted. The idea is that such a
system should be able to cost *nothing* - so the target audience is
people using Linux (or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSD&lt;/span&gt; or Solaris) or an existing Windows
installation, along with a simple server - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another
database, along with some web server running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that my
Java isn&amp;#8217;t what it used to be - but more to the point, frankly, if I&amp;#8217;m
the only person working on this, it&amp;#8217;ll take years to finish. So,
hopefully, when I get a more concrete plan, I&amp;#8217;ll be able to enlist some
other developers - especially someone more knowledgeable than me about
how best to deal with data caching (in the event - or certainty, as in
wireless or vehicular applications - of a loss of connectivity), mobile
devices, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIPPA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall idea is to design a platform that is a base for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPCR&lt;/span&gt; -
something that can handle data collection, printing a hard copy,
analysis, administration, security, etc. - and all the while be
organization-independent. In essence, a framework. Firstly, after having
this problem with &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools&lt;/a&gt;, it
should all be designed with i18n/L10n in mind from the beginning,
providing good and easy support for translations. More importantly, all
settings should be configurable. To top off the problem, anything that&amp;#8217;s
obviously organization-specific - like the data set, layout of input
forms on the screen, reports on the data, printed copy (both blank and
filled-in), user access rights/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBAC&lt;/span&gt;, authentication methods, etc. -
should all be designed as pluggable modules. The end result would be a
system where a single organization or group of organizations can develop
- or pay to have developed - a &amp;#8220;module&amp;#8221; that includes all of this. The
license would have additional terms stating that any changes to the
code, modules, or updates to modules *must* be given back to the
openEPCR community. The general idea is something like this scenario:
the state of New Jersey decides to adopt a standardized &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCR&lt;/span&gt; and data
set. Many volunteer ambulance squads don&amp;#8217;t have the funds for a
commercial solution. A bunch of them pool their resources or funds and
develop a &amp;#8220;module&amp;#8221; for openEPCR that provides everything required to
implement a printed and electronic version of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt; state &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCR&lt;/span&gt;. If a
single organization wishes to deviate, they can simply &amp;#8220;extend&amp;#8221; that
module as they see fit, building off of the main code. OpenEPCR itself
remains neutral, but provides a repository of modules to use or&amp;nbsp;modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see it, there are three main&amp;nbsp;difficulties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing something that&amp;#8217;s abstracted to such a great&amp;nbsp;degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with data when we don&amp;#8217;t know the environment - we might be
    stand-alone, always connected to a single master database server,
    intermittently connected, or even connecting to a different server
    every&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want centralized administration - optimally, all custom data,
    settings, and organization-specific information (as well as updates
    to this) will be pushed out from a central server to all clients.
    But we need to assure security in an environment that is untrusted
    and may even be hostile - perhaps even hostile users - and balance
    the fact that some instances of the software may be actively
    collecting and recording data before they have been notified of a
    certain change or&amp;nbsp;update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you think this sounds interesting, or have any suggestions - from
either the technical or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; standpoint - please check out the &lt;a href="http://www.openepcr.org"&gt;project
homepage&lt;/a&gt; or drop me an
&lt;a href="mailto:jason@jasonantman.com"&gt;E-Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpted from the homepage is a bit of information on my&amp;nbsp;goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Mission:&lt;/strong&gt;
OpenEPCR aims to provide the Emergency Medical Services sector with a
Free (as in Freedom, a.k.a. Open-Source) Electronic Patient Care Report
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPCR&lt;/span&gt;) software solution. Licensed under the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" title="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
it will be easily extendable by users&amp;#8217; organizations. Such a solution
does not currently exist. Furthermore, many states and regions are
moving to electronic data aggregation for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;. OpenEPCR aims to provide
an easy way for organizations to adopt a standardized data set and
submit their data - and only the data that they choose - to a trusted
third party. The software will attempt to do all of this while paying
heed to applicable standards on privacy and security, as well as being
fully&amp;nbsp;platform-independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project&amp;nbsp;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; code licensed under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;, and make code as
    easy as possible to modify and&amp;nbsp;extend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be fully platform-independent and database-independent, running in a
    platform-independent&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; reliance whatsoever on outside services i.e. be able to run
    in a disaster situation with a full communications&amp;nbsp;breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be designed with internationalization (i18n) and localization in
    mind, specifically with easy support for&amp;nbsp;translations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all data set, user information, rights/access management,
    authentication, and authorization abstracted, allowing
    organization-specified rules as well as various authentication means
    (central server, local file, passwords, hardware tokens, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to conform to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIPPA&lt;/span&gt; and other applicable standards governing
    security and&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow all organizational data such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCR&lt;/span&gt; forms, data sets,
    printable versions, etc. to operate as pluggable modules; changing
    the entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCR&lt;/span&gt; structure should be as easy as adding a few new files
    and running a&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be designed with both the small, volunteer, virtually budget-less
    squad and the large paid organization in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run on a variety of devices including desktops, laptops, and mobile
    devices of all&amp;nbsp;flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operate in environments including standalone, central server, ad-hoc
    network, and a network of distributed master&amp;nbsp;servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the utmost regard to integrity of data - data loss or
    corruption is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; an&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support virtually unlimited customization for an end-user&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be designed with ease of extension in mind - it should be easy for
    end-user organizations to design custom add-ons that integrate
    fully, while conforming to the Access Control&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, include support for administrative functions such as
    equipment/vehicle checks, scheduling, roster functionality,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, consider creation of an integrated incident management
    system for patient, resource, and personnel&amp;nbsp;tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be designed with as much space for custom software hooks as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to pull together developers from various disciplines and
    gather suggestions from a vast sampling of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/li&gt;
