It provides a Java daemon to read and parse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html"&gt;detailed billing reports&lt;/a&gt;
and a web interface to the data (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ice/blob/master/README.md#screenshots"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt;). The single biggest feature for us
is the ability to do cost breakdowns (by hour/day/week/month) based on Cost Allocation tags in the detailed billing reports. We tag every billable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;
resource with the Application Name, Service Class (environment; dev/test/prod) and Responsible Party. Ice lets us configure &amp;#8220;Application Groups&amp;#8221;
based on applications as seen from a business/budgetary standpoint and allow up-to-the-hour data on that available to anyone who needs&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spun up the development install of Ice for a few weeks to give it a spin, but once people started complaining that my screen session died and took
Ice with it, it was clear we needed a real, permanent installation. While there is &lt;a href="https://github.com/mdsol/ice_cookbook"&gt;chef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Answers4AWS/netflixoss-ansible"&gt;ansible&lt;/a&gt;
code to install and configure Ice, we&amp;#8217;re a Puppet shop, and there wasn&amp;#8217;t anything available that I could find for Puppet. So, I set about writing a
module to install and configure Ice, running in Tomcat behind an Nginx proxy. Like any good modern module, I wanted not only &lt;a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/"&gt;rspec-puppet&lt;/a&gt;
unit tests but also &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker"&gt;beaker&lt;/a&gt; acceptance tests. For those unfamiliar, Beaker is an acceptance testing framework for Puppet
that&amp;#8217;s similar to Test Kitchen; it spins up Vagrant machines, runs some code in them, and then uses &lt;a href="http://serverspec.org/"&gt;serverspec&lt;/a&gt; to make assertions about
the state of the system (file contents, running processes, command output, etc.) (side note: if you used Beaker prior to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/blob/master/HISTORY.md#beaker2.0.0"&gt;2.0 release&lt;/a&gt; in December 2014, you should really try it again; they&amp;#8217;ve made some great&amp;nbsp;improvements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This posed a bit of a challenge, as Ice (in addition to being pretty poorly documented) is really designed to run in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;. Firstly, the very reason we started running Ice was
to get a handle on our fast-growing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; spend; as a result, we&amp;#8217;re trying hard not to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; for small-scale projects that could use existing resources. Second, while our
company very unfortunately doesn&amp;#8217;t have an open source policy and isn&amp;#8217;t releasing anything (hopefully this may be changing soon), we try hard to write generic, forge-quality&amp;nbsp;modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I wanted to use the default Vagrant/VirtualBox provider for Beaker. To make matters worse, in keeping with the spirit of a community module, I didn&amp;#8217;t
want the acceptance tests to require anything specific to my company, such as an S3 bucket preseeded with our billing data. Ice both reads the detailed billing reports
(one of its three inputs; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; pricing data and your accounts&amp;#8217; reservation pricing/capacity being the others) and writes state from and to S3. So, this was a bit difficult.
As we don&amp;#8217;t plan on upgrading Ice terribly often, and we wanted to install from the &lt;a href="https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/ice-master/"&gt;cloudbees master builds&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted
acceptance testing of not just the provisioning tooling, but also some basic smoke tests for the application&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to come up with a working, albeit somewhat Rube Goldberg, method of getting isolated acceptance tests to work. What follows is the gist of how I got Ice
working in complete isolation. The majority of this happens in &lt;code&gt;spec/acceptance/0prerequisite_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt; which runs first and both does the prerequisite setup
and validates that everything is setup right and working for the tests. The following solution is based on the amazingly helpful &lt;a href="https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3"&gt;fakes3&lt;/a&gt;
Ruby gem, the &lt;a href="http://www.apsis.ch/pound/"&gt;Pound&lt;/a&gt; reverse proxy, and some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificate trickery. While my code was specific to Beaker, this should be generic
enough to use with any system acceptance testing&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we obtain or create some files that we&amp;#8217;ll need on the test&amp;nbsp;instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a relatively recent Detailed Billing With Resources and Tags zipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; report from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; account of yours (the filename is in the format
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ACCOUNT NUMBER&amp;gt;-aws-billing-detailed-line-items-with-resources-and-tags-&amp;lt;YYYY&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;MM&amp;gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt;). Manually trim it down to a sufficient sample of data;
    I took a few hours&amp;#8217; worth of data from one day and trimmed it down to just that referencing a few randomly chosen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instances, ELBs, on-demand &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;
    instances and reserved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances. I then anonymized the account number, resource IDs, tag values, and anything else identifying. Ice needs billing
    data in order to do anything, so this will serve as our test&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ice runs, it attempts to retrieve reserved instance pricing. It appears (I&amp;#8217;ve lost the mailing list or GitHub issue reference) that it&amp;#8217;s typical for
    the first Ice run on an empty S3 work directory to die because these files are missing. As a result, grab the &lt;code&gt;reservation_prices.oneyear.*&lt;/code&gt; files from
    the S3 work bucket of a running/working Ice installation. This will prevent a time-consuming shutdown of Ice on the first&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a self-signed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; key and certificate for &lt;code&gt;fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;. Package them together in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEM&lt;/span&gt; file suitable for use in web servers.
    (Note that most modern S3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; clients accept a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a bucket, as there are now third parties that implement the S3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Ice does not; it connects
    to https://&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUCKETNAME&lt;/span&gt;.s3amazonaws.com. As a result, this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; foolery is&amp;nbsp;required.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setup"&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/fakes3"&gt;fakes3&lt;/a&gt; rubygem; this provides an s3-compliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; backed by local filesystem storage.
    Configure it to run during your tests (I set it up as a systemd service, but there are certainly other ways to do this). Note that
    while fakes3 stores the uploaded data on the local filesystem, it maintains a mapping of known objects in memory; as such, the process
    always starts completely empty, regardless of what&amp;#8217;s in the backing directory on the filesystem. fakes3 allows all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; credentials,
    so fake ones are fine. It also automatically creates buckets the first time they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href="http://www.apsis.ch/pound/"&gt;pound&lt;/a&gt; reverse proxy and configure it to listen on port 443 with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEM&lt;/span&gt; file you generated
    earlier, and proxy to fakes3 (which listens by default on port 10000). The &lt;code&gt;ListenHTTPS&lt;/code&gt;section of &lt;code&gt;pound.cfg&lt;/code&gt; will need the
    &lt;code&gt;xHTTP 1&lt;/code&gt; directive in order to enable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; verbs other than&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a local hosts file entry pointing &lt;code&gt;fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fakes3 starts, upload your sample billing data file and your reserved instance pricing files to the appropriate paths under a
    bucket called &amp;#8220;fakebucket&amp;#8221;. You can use a tool such as &lt;a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd"&gt;s3cmd&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate its contents, and other
    supported tools are listed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3/wiki/Supported-Clients"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This step also serves
    to validate your Pound configuration, which should pass &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; port 443 traffic through to fakes3 and allow you to store and
    retrieve&amp;nbsp;objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out the path to the trusted keystore for the version of Java that you&amp;#8217;re running Ice under. On CentOS 7 with OpenJDK 1.7.0,
    this was (after a lot of symlinks) &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/cacerts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import your self-signed certificate into the Java keystore as a trusted certificate. This will allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; verification to succeed even
    with a self-signed&amp;nbsp;certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;/bin/keytool -importcert -alias fakebucket -file fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com.crt -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -trustcacerts -noprompt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;code&gt;ice.properties&lt;/code&gt; for the above. The important and unintuitive parts that I found&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going by the above examples, your billing and work S3 bucket names should both be&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;fakebucket&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to mock out bigger parts of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; metadata service, run Ice with
   &lt;code&gt;-Dice.s3AccessKeyId=NotAValidAccessKeyId -Dice.s3SecretKey=NotAValidAwsSecretKeyXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;
   in the &lt;code&gt;JAVA_OPTS&lt;/code&gt;. If Ice can&amp;#8217;t retrieve an instance&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; role from the metadata service
   (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/) and doesn&amp;#8217;t have the
   access and secret keys defined, it won&amp;#8217;t run. Also note that while the documentation is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
   unclear on this, a number of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ice/issues/49#issuecomment-23497701"&gt;github issues&lt;/a&gt;
   clarify that these need to be passed in as Java runtime options; they can&amp;#8217;t be put in the properties&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable the Reservation Capacity Poller (&lt;code&gt;ice.reservationCapacityPoller=false&lt;/code&gt;). This service
   needs to connect to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, and will cause Ice to die if it&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For testing purposes, it&amp;#8217;s a lot simpler and less error-prone (as well as being a lot faster) to
   test the processor and reader separately - at least in serial instead of simultaneously in the same&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all this is done, running the Ice Processor should retrieve the billing file, process it, and write the processed data to the
fakes3 bucket. Running the Reader should display the data properly. So far I&amp;#8217;ve been unable to find any features (other than the
Reservation Capacity Poller, noted above) that don&amp;#8217;t work with this&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;#8217;s related to Ice itself or ideas for acceptance testing isolated applications, I hope this can be of use to&amp;nbsp;someone&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="netflix"></category><category term="ice"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="beaker"></category><category term="acceptance testing"></category><category term="aws"></category><category term="s3"></category><category term="fakes3"></category><category term="testing"></category></entry><entry><title>How Yum and RPM Compare Versions</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/07/how-yum-and-rpm-compare-versions/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-11T23:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-07-11:2014/07/how-yum-and-rpm-compare-versions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently tripped up by a bug in Puppet, &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1244"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUP&lt;/span&gt;-1244&lt;/a&gt;,
dealing with how it compares package versions. All of Puppet&amp;#8217;s Package types assumed
&lt;a href="http://semver.org/"&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt;, and that&amp;#8217;s far from the case for RPMs and therefore Yum. This
manifested itself in how Puppet validates package installations - if a version was explicitly specified
and Yum/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; could install it, puppet would shell out to them and install the package, but then report
a failure in its post-install validation, as the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; version string specified isn&amp;#8217;t present.
For example, many RedHat/CentOS packages (such as those from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPEL&lt;/span&gt;) include a release string with the major
version of the distribution they were packged for - i.e. &amp;#8220;.el5&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;.el6&amp;#8221;. If Puppet was instructed to
install package &amp;#8220;foo&amp;#8221; version &amp;#8220;1.2.3&amp;#8221;, but the actual package in the repositories was &amp;#8220;foo-1.2.3-el5&amp;#8221;,
Puppet would cause the package to be installed, but then report&amp;nbsp;failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut a &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/2866"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; against the Puppet4 branch to
fix these issues, essentially re-implementing yum and rpm&amp;#8217;s version comparison logic in Ruby. It took
me a few days of research and sorting through source code (and in the process I found that &lt;code&gt;yum&lt;/code&gt;, despite
its use in so many distributions, has no unit tests at all) but I finally got it finished. In the process,
I found out exactly how&amp;#8230; weird&amp;#8230; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s version comparison rules&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="package-naming-and-parsing"&gt;Package Naming and&amp;nbsp;Parsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; package names are made up of five parts; the package name, epoch, version, release, and architecture.
This format is commonly referred to as the acronym &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEVRA&lt;/span&gt;. The epoch is not always included; it is assumed
to be zero (0) on any packages that lack it explicitly. The format for the whole string is &lt;code&gt;n-e:v-r.a&lt;/code&gt;.
For my purposes, I was only really concerned with comparing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVR&lt;/span&gt; portion; Puppet knows about package names
and the bug herein was with what Puppet calls the &amp;#8220;version&amp;#8221; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVR&lt;/span&gt; in yum/rpm parlance). Parsing is pretty&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; in the string, everything before it is the epoch. If not, the epoch is&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;remaining&lt;/em&gt; string, everything before the first &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; is the version,
  and everything after it is the release. If there isn&amp;#8217;t one, the release is considered&amp;nbsp;null/nill/None/whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-yum-compares-evr"&gt;How Yum Compares&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the package string is parsed into its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVR&lt;/span&gt; components, yum calls &lt;code&gt;rpmUtils.miscutils.compareEVR()&lt;/code&gt;,
which does some data type massaging for the inputs, and then calls out to &lt;code&gt;rpm.labelCompare()&lt;/code&gt;
(found in &lt;code&gt;rpm.git/python/header-py.c&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;labelCompare()&lt;/code&gt; sets each epoch
to &amp;#8220;0&amp;#8221; if it was null/Nonem, and then uses &lt;code&gt;compare_values()&lt;/code&gt; to compare each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVR&lt;/span&gt; portion, which in turn falls through
to a function called &lt;code&gt;rpmvercmp()&lt;/code&gt; (see below). The algorithm for &lt;code&gt;labelCompare()&lt;/code&gt; is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set each epoch value to 0 if it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;null/None.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the epoch values using &lt;code&gt;compare_values()&lt;/code&gt;. If they&amp;#8217;re not equal, return that result, else
   move on to the next portion (version). The logic within &lt;code&gt;compare_values()&lt;/code&gt; is that if one is empty/null
   and the other is not, the non-empty one is greater, and that ends the comparison. If neither of
   them is empty/not present, compare them using &lt;code&gt;rpmvercmp()&lt;/code&gt; and follow the same logic; if one
   is &amp;#8220;greater&amp;#8221; (newer) than the other, that&amp;#8217;s the end result of the comparison. Otherwise, move
   on to the next component&amp;nbsp;(version).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the versions using the same&amp;nbsp;logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the releases using the same&amp;nbsp;logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all of the components are &amp;#8220;equal&amp;#8221;, the packages are the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real magic, obviously, happens in &lt;code&gt;rpmvercmp()&lt;/code&gt;, the rpm library function to compare two
versions (or epochs, or releases). That&amp;#8217;s also where the madness&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-rpm-compares-version-parts"&gt;How &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; Compares Version&amp;nbsp;Parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; is written in C. Converting all of the buffer and pointer processing for these strings
over to Ruby was quite a pain. That being said, I didn&amp;#8217;t make this up, this is actually the
algorithm that &lt;code&gt;rpmvercmp()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;lib/rpmvercmp.c&lt;/code&gt;) uses to compare version &amp;#8220;parts&amp;#8221;
(epoch, version, release). This function returns 0 if the strings are equal, 1 if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; (the
first string argument) is newer than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; (the second string argument), or -1 if
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is older than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. Also keep in mind that this uses pointers in C, so it works by removing
a sequence of 0 or more characters from the front of each string, comparing them, and then repeating
for the remaining characters in each string until something is unequal, or a string reaches its&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the strings are binary equal (&lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt;), they&amp;#8217;re equal, return&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop over the strings, left-to-right.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trim anything that&amp;#8217;s not &lt;code&gt;[A-Za-z0-9]&lt;/code&gt; or tilde (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) from the front of both&amp;nbsp;strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If both strings start with a tilde, discard it and move on to the next&amp;nbsp;character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If string &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; starts with a tilde and string &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; does not, return -1 (string &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is older);
   and the inverse if string &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; starts with a tilde and string &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; does&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End the loop if either string has reached zero&amp;nbsp;length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first character of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a digit, pop the leading chunk of continuous digits from
   each string (which may be &amp;#8221; for &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; if only one &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; starts with digits). If &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; begins
   with a letter, do the same for leading&amp;nbsp;letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the segement from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; had 0 length, return ` if the segment from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was numeric, or
   &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; if it was alphabetic. The logical result of this is that if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; begins with numbers
   and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; does not, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is newer (return 1). If &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; begins with letters and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; does not,
   then &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is older (return -1). If the leading character(s) from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; were both
   numbers or both letters, continue&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the leading segments were both numeric, discard any leading zeros and &lt;em&gt;whichever one is longer
   wins&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is longer than &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; (without leading zeroes), return 1, and vice-versa. If
   they&amp;#8217;re of the same length, continue&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the leading segments with &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Ruby). If that returns a non-zero
   value, then return that value. Else continue to the next iteration of the&amp;nbsp;loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the loop ended (nothing has been returned yet, either both strings are totally the same or they&amp;#8217;re
   the same up to the end of one of them, like with &amp;#8220;1.2.3&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;1.2.3b&amp;#8221;), then the longest wins -
   if what&amp;#8217;s left of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is longer than what&amp;#8217;s left of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, return 1. Vice-versa for if what&amp;#8217;s
   left of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is longer than what&amp;#8217;s left of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. And finally, if what&amp;#8217;s left of them is the same
   length, return&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there you have it. Quite convoluted. And full of things like the &amp;#8220;~&amp;#8221; magic character (&amp;#8220;~1&amp;#8221; is always
older than&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;9999zzzz&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rpm"></category><category term="yum"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="versions"></category></entry><entry><title>Puppet facter facts for syslog daemon type and version, symantec netbackup</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/08/puppet-facter-facts-for-syslog-daemon-type-and-version-symantec-netbackup/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-25T11:33:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-08-25:2012/08/puppet-facter-facts-for-syslog-daemon-type-and-version-symantec-netbackup/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a few more custom facts that I&amp;#8217;ve added to my

manifests to configure my puppet nodes. Without an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s pretty
difficult to get a good ovewview of what classes are used on each node,
and what nodes use a given class. I know I could write up a simple web
tool to do this (unfortunately, given my limited Ruby knowledge, it
would have to be in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or Perl, not a real modification to Dashboard in
Ruby). But where to get the data&amp;nbsp;from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I found a &lt;a href="http://sjoeboo.github.com/blog/2012/07/31/updated-puppet-facts-for-puppet-classes/"&gt;puppet fact for puppet
classes&lt;/a&gt;
on &lt;a href="http://sjoeboo.github.com/"&gt;Matthew Nicholson&amp;#8217;s Coffee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Beer blog&lt;/a&gt;.
It parses &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/puppet/classes.txt&lt;/code&gt; and returns the list of classes
found as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; array. Great base, but I wanted something easier, that
would be more easily parsed from its direct storage in MySQL. My
modification to his code is onlty a few characters; I dropped out the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; require, and return the classes as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; list. This lets me to easy
&lt;code&gt;LIKE '%,classname,%'&lt;/code&gt; SELECTs in MySQL, and also gives me the fact
value stored in the puppet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;, so I can build a separate tool around
that data. Thanks,&amp;nbsp;Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; at
work to view the status of our puppet nodes. While it&amp;#8217;s very handy,
there&amp;#8217;s one feature I really wanted: the ability to show the value of
arbitrary puppet facts in the main node table on the home page.
Specifically, the facts we use for environment (we have eng/dev, qa,
prod, and test puppet environments), zone (physical location) and last
applied configuration version. I&amp;#8217;m not terribly experience with Ruby,
but I managed to muddle my way through a working patch to do this, along
with options in the settings file to enable it and configure the facts.
You&amp;#8217;ll need to restart dashboard (or your web server) to change the
facts, of course. The commit is currently &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/puppet-dashboard/commit/5364e2b0188d18ae62c355279e58c7ce6d7db654"&gt;available on
github&lt;/a&gt;,
but it doesn&amp;#8217;t strictly follow the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-dashboard/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;puppet-dashboard contributing
checklist&lt;/a&gt;
so I may have to redo&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/dashboard_after_patch.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dashboard screenshot after
patch" src="/GFX/dashboard_after_patch_sm.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s that the configuration section added to settings.yml looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Enables display of arbitrary node facts in &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; page node table, between node name and latest report time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;enable_home_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If enable_home_facts is true, the fact names and column headings to display. Simply repeat the following two line pairs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# as needed:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#- name: &amp;#39;factname&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#  heading: &amp;#39;heading text&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;home_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;environment&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Env&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;zone&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Zone&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;catalog_config_version&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If I feel really adventurous, I&amp;#8217;d like to implement my other big wish,
some sort of pop-up list of links, based on arbitrary facts (mainly
hostname and fqdn) for each node - something where I can mouse over the
node name/table cell, and see links (static URLs with node
name/fqdn/other facts plugged in) to things like Nagios/Icinga, our
backup system,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dashboard"></category><category term="facts"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category></entry><entry><title>Instagram - Scaling a Startup</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/04/instagram-scaling-a-startup/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-24T19:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-04-24:2012/04/instagram-scaling-a-startup/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you keep up with news on the &amp;#8216;net, you may have heard about photo

relatively popular in the software and systems architecture world; the
simple text-based format makes it quiet simple, and the directed graph
(dot file) is a simple method to store a graph of information flow or
component relationships. &lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; includes
builtin support for &lt;a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/faq.html#how-do-i-use-puppets-graphing-support"&gt;generating dot
graphs&lt;/a&gt;
of its configuration resources and relationships (both those specified
by the user, and all relationships including ones generated by Puppet&amp;nbsp;itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the common uses for puppet&amp;#8217;s graphs is to identify dependency
cycles, as cyclic dependencies cause an error condition. However,
Puppet&amp;#8217;s own
&lt;a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/faq.html#how-do-i-use-puppets-graphing-support"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
only mentions using the &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; command to generate a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; graphical
representation of the the graph. When debugging a recent problem with
puppet, I ended up with a message&amp;nbsp;like:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Could not apply complete catalog: Found dependency cycles in the following relationships: Service[puppet] =&amp;gt; File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml/foreman], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml] =&amp;gt; File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml/foreman], Service[puppet] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/node.rb], File[fileserver.conf] =&amp;gt; Service[apache], File[namespaceauth.conf] =&amp;gt; Service[apache], File[puppet.conf] =&amp;gt; Service[apache], File[puppet.conf] =&amp;gt; Service[puppet], Service[puppet] =&amp;gt; File[foreman-report.rb], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml/foreman] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], Service[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], File[foreman-proxy-settings.yml] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], Package[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], User[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], File[foreman-report.rb] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], File[/etc/puppet/node.rb] =&amp;gt; Package[puppet-server], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml/foreman] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], Service[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], File[foreman-proxy-settings.yml] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], Package[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], User[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], File[foreman-report.rb] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], File[/etc/puppet/node.rb] =&amp;gt; Exec[create_puppetmaster_certs], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml/foreman] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], Service[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], File[foreman-proxy-settings.yml] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], Package[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], User[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], File[/var/lib/puppet/yaml] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], File[foreman-report.rb] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], File[/etc/puppet/node.rb] =&amp;gt; File[/etc/puppet/environments], File[foreman-proxy-settings.yml] =&amp;gt; Service[foreman-proxy], Package[foreman-proxy] =&amp;gt; Service[foreman-proxy], Service[puppet]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not exactly easy to follow, or to pull much meaning out of, even if I
did some slight reformatting by putting in some newlines. I then
generated the png as described in the Puppet FAQs, but even scrolling
back and forth on this for 20 minutes didn&amp;#8217;t help: &lt;em&gt;(note: link is to
the original 14405x665px png)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="/GFX/relationships.dot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="dot file
png" src="/GFX/relationships.dot.small.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little research, I managed to find the
&lt;a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov"&gt;NetworkX&lt;/a&gt; package for Python; according to
their site, &amp;#8220;NetworkX is a Python language software package for the
creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and
functions of complex networks.&amp;#8221; Among its features are the ability to
&lt;a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/drawing.html#module-networkx.drawing.nx_pydot"&gt;read dot
files&lt;/a&gt;
using the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/pydot/"&gt;pydot&lt;/a&gt; library, and the
ability to &lt;a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.simple_cycles.html#networkx.algorithms.cycles.simple_cycles"&gt;find simple
cycles&lt;/a&gt;
within a graph. In about 20 minutes, I hacked together the dead-simple
script&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a dot file (of the type generated, for example, by Puppet), this
will output all of the cycles found within the graph. I ran this script
on the &lt;code&gt;expanded_relationships.dot&lt;/code&gt; file from Puppet, which had 99 nodes
(nodes on the graph, not puppet clients), and got the following&amp;nbsp;output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;File[foreman-report.rb]&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;File[puppet.conf]&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Service[puppet]&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;File[foreman-report.rb]&amp;#39;]

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It probably would have taken me hours to come up with that by hand, let
alone realize that &lt;code&gt;Service[puppet]&lt;/code&gt; is the common item in all of them,
and hence the problem. With that little tidbit of information, I managed
to track down an extraneous &amp;#8220;require puppet&amp;#8221; that this all originated
from. I sincerely hope that this script will save someone else at least
as much time as it took me to write (I know it will for&amp;nbsp;me&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always obtain the latest version of this script from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/dot_find_cycles.py"&gt;my github repository&lt;/a&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s free for use
and distribution, provided that you leave my copyright/attribution and
source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; notice intact, update the changelog, and send any
features/fixes back to me. The script is written in Python, and depends
on the python-networkx, graphviz-python, and pydot packages (all of
which are available as packages in the default repos of Fedora and
CentOS at least). For Puppet purposes, I&amp;#8217;d recommend running this on
&lt;code&gt;expanded_relationships.dot&lt;/code&gt; to get the full&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

traffic to my blog, probably because it still seems to be one of the
only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt; comparisons out there. Both Dashboard (and Puppet Enterprise
Console) and The Foreman have changed quite a bit since I wrote this.
Foreman has certainly been developed at warp speed. I&amp;#8217;ll try to write an
update to this sometime soon, but be advised that the information here
is somewhat&amp;nbsp;dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we&amp;#8217;re in the process of rolling out
&lt;a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet"&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt; for
configuration management of our servers. It will be an integral part of
the provisioning process of all new physical and virtual hosts, and will
also be phased in on existing hosts as possible. Right now, we have an
initial puppet install that was &amp;#8220;development&amp;#8221;, but we&amp;#8217;re about to move
to &amp;#8220;production&amp;#8221; (new puppetmaster in our production infrastructure,
production MySQL, etc.). We&amp;#8217;ve been using
&lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/dashboard/"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;,
but just as a report viewer. Up until now, we&amp;#8217;ve been using nodes.pp and
per-node flat-file manifests. I&amp;#8217;ve got a few issues with this, but the
biggest is that all of our node definitions (and their classes and
parameters) live in the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository as our modules and other
puppet configuration. Not only does this mean a checkout and commit just
to change a node parameter or add a module/class to a node, but it also
means that for my team members who don&amp;#8217;t have previous puppet
experience, it greatly blurs the line between administering puppet
(developing and maintaining modules) and using puppet (building a node,
changing node params or modules/classes), since both tasks are
accomplished in the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve been pushing an &lt;a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html"&gt;External Node Classifier
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; with a web
interface as one of the biggest feature enhancements we need for our
puppet install. The complicating factor is that I&amp;#8217;ve been given a time
frame of approximately 1 week to get the &amp;#8220;production&amp;#8221; puppetmaster
running on our production infrastructure and marked as &amp;#8220;done&amp;#8221;. That
includes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;. At my last gig, at Rutgers University, I wrote our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;
in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; (actually I wrote it for my half-dozen or so boxes at home, and
brought it to Rutgers gratis), and it also handled kickstart file
distribution and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; configuration, and was extended to also set &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; for the hosts - a one-stop solution. Unfortunately the code is
very organization-specific, not terribly solid, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; looks awful,
so it&amp;#8217;s not a fit for the current employer. So I have to find something
else that fits the bill. I have a list of initial (&amp;#8220;phase 1&amp;#8221;)
requirements that are a mix of functionality that we require and
management&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must support environments, since we make use of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must support default values for parameters based on environment,
    &amp;#8220;zone&amp;#8221; (a custom fact and variable we define), or a combination of&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For accountability and legal reasons, must have full auditing of all
    changes by all users (and, obviously, support&amp;nbsp;authentication).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display node last run time and&amp;nbsp;status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as at least the ability to implement some of our phase 2&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to show modules and classes applied to a node, including
    those required/included through other&amp;nbsp;modules/classes/roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should support at least some level of puppet report&amp;nbsp;display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to trigger a node run (kick) from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some level of permission separation, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACL&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBAC&lt;/span&gt; so that we could
    potentially delegate control of a certain module or parameter, on a
    certain group of nodes, to the development&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per-node links to other tools such as Icinga/Nagios or our&amp;nbsp;wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some way of detecting valid classes and modules (and our &amp;#8220;role&amp;#8221;
    module) per-environment (i.e. available modules/classes/roles should
    be pulled from the configs, not manually&amp;nbsp;entered).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to display puppet docs from&amp;nbsp;modules/classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current situation makes this even more difficult: we&amp;#8217;re an
operations team of five (hiring at the moment to fill the position of
the sixth), and I believe I&amp;#8217;m the only member of the team with any real
software development experience. And none of us have experience with
Ruby (which Puppet and most of its universe is written in). This means
that any in-house solution runs the risk of being unmaintainable should
I get hit by a bus (some of our team have various levels of experience
with Perl and other scripting languages, but not really from an app
development perspective). Because of these reasons, there&amp;#8217;s a management
aversion to anything that we code ourselves (well, these reasons, and
the fact that with a shorthanded team we don&amp;#8217;t have much time for
projects without an immediate&amp;nbsp;impact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I spent hours looking around online trying to find existing
web-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt; projects, and came up with a pretty small&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/dashboard/"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;,
    the Puppet Labs web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s the most common web-based puppet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt; as
    far as I know, and since it&amp;#8217;s an official Puppet Labs project (and
    the basis for their Puppet Enterprise &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;), its future is pretty
    secure. But it&amp;#8217;s still very basic (let alone enterprise features),
    and has a plugin system that is very&amp;nbsp;young.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman"&gt;The Foreman&lt;/a&gt; is probably
    the second-most-common puppet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;, and has also been around about as
    long as Dashboard. Its features are nice, and it includes support
    for Kickstart (management of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TFTP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, as well as some
    virtual machine management. Unfortunately, we already have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; and
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure so I&amp;#8217;m sure it would be quite a bit of effort to
    integrate it with our environment, and for a non-Ruby shop, it has
    the same problem with maintainability of custom&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ingent.net/projects/initr/wiki"&gt;initr&lt;/a&gt;, a
    &lt;a href="http://www.redmine.org/"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt; plugin that functions as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;
    and manages modules. It includes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBAC&lt;/span&gt; and leverages Redmine. But
    since we don&amp;#8217;t use Redmine, it&amp;#8217;s not much of an&amp;nbsp;advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gitorious.org/opennms-puppet-node-pusher"&gt;OpenNMS Puppet Node
    Pusher&lt;/a&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;
    script for &lt;a href="http://www.opennms.org/"&gt;OpenNMS&lt;/a&gt;, which we also don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty amazed to see that nobody had written a puppet web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENC&lt;/span&gt;
in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; (or Perl or Python), especially since Puppet is now quite&amp;nbsp;popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m essentially left with the following&amp;nbsp;options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start from scratch and write my own in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;. By far the worst option,
    since we don&amp;#8217;t have anyone on our team who&amp;#8217;s likely to maintain it,
    and the Puppet community is&amp;nbsp;Ruby-focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Foreman, since it&amp;#8217;s the only one that appears to offer audit
    logging, have a bunch of features that don&amp;#8217;t work for us, and
    hopefully deal with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn Ruby, write plugins for Dashboard, and hope that Puppet Labs
    or someone else will pick them up and maintain them if I&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to investigate Foreman and initr in a bit
more depth, and also play around with the Dashboard code and try to pick
up some Ruby (as they&amp;#8217;re all written in Ruby anyway). I&amp;#8217;ll also discuss
these options with the team and see how opinions go (keeping in mind
that the higher the likelihood of the community picking up/merging my
changes, the&amp;nbsp;better).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dashboard"></category><category term="foreman"></category><category term="node classifier"></category><category term="puppet"></category></entry><entry><title>Puppet Syntax Highlighting with GeSHi</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/01/puppet-syntax-highlighting-with-geshi/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-11T12:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-01-11:2012/01/puppet-syntax-highlighting-with-geshi/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog is run on wordpress, and I also do quite a bit in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, so I&amp;#8217;m
familiar with the &lt;a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/"&gt;GeSHi&lt;/a&gt; syntax
highlighter. It&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;-based, and can run both as a Wordpress plugin
(&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Syntax&lt;/a&gt;) and as a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; module. It also works quite well with the MediaWiki &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi"&gt;SyntaxHighlight
GeSHi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was documenting some &lt;a href="http://www.puppet.org"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; code in a
wiki, and realized that I didn&amp;#8217;t have syntax highlighting. Well, fellow
Linux sysadmin and puppetmaster Jason Hancock was nice enough to post on
his blog (&lt;a href="http://geek.jasonhancock.com/2011/10/14/puppet-syntax-highlighting-geshi/"&gt;Puppet Syntax Highlighting with

&lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;-related. Unfortunately, Puppet (at
least the old 0.25.4 client that I&amp;#8217;m running) doesn&amp;#8217;t timestamp the
debug logs sent to stdout. I know it&amp;#8217;s hanging somewhere, but I need
concrete numbers to look at. Here&amp;#8217;s a wonderfully simple bash script
that timestamps everything sent to it on stdin, and echoes it back to&amp;nbsp;stdout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATECMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;date +%H:%M:%S&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;read &lt;/span&gt;line; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATECMD&lt;/span&gt;) $line&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Call it as simply as: &lt;code&gt;command | ~/bin/ts&lt;/code&gt;, or maybe like
&lt;code&gt;command 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 | ~/bin/ts | tee foo.log&lt;/code&gt;. Dead simple, but very helpful
when the developers didn&amp;#8217;t think to timestamp debug log&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="debugging"></category><category term="logs"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category><category term="timestamp"></category></entry><entry><title>Client-side subversion commit message hooks</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/01/client-side-subversion-commit-message-hooks/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-05T11:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-01-05:2011/01/client-side-subversion-commit-message-hooks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I know this isn&amp;#8217;t best practice, since we use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt;-based auth for
our Linux boxes (including a sudoers file based on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; group
membership), we usually do work on some boxes as root (&lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt;).
This includes our &lt;a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/"&gt;puppetmaster&lt;/a&gt;, where
configs are kept in subversion and edited as root. The one problem with
this is how to get the username of the actual committer, not root, in
subversion&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory that I came up with is a &lt;a href="/2011/01/how-to-get-actual-login-username-when-using-sudo-su/"&gt;shell script that finds out who the
actual user
is&lt;/a&gt;, and
then tacking this onto the beginning of the subversion commit message
(since there&amp;#8217;s no real way to do client-side hooks in subversion). While
I struggled with subversion&amp;#8217;s lack of good client hooks, I came up with
a theory based on a script that preloads svn-commit.tmp and then calls
the text editor. It&amp;#8217;s actually quite&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in your .bashrc or wherever you setup environment variables,
&lt;code&gt;export SVN_EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/svnPreCommitClientHook.sh&lt;/code&gt;. This way,
every time you run &lt;code&gt;svn commit&lt;/code&gt;, instead of calling your text editor
with &lt;code&gt;svn-commit.tmp&lt;/code&gt; as an argument, the bash script will do what it
needs to (commit message preloading) with svn-commit.tmp and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; call
your editor to finish the&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/svnPreCommitClientHook.sh&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin/getLogname.py&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# script to get user&amp;#39;s actual login name, even if using sudo su&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;\nBY: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGNAME&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; svn-commit.foo
cat svn-commit.tmp &amp;gt;&amp;gt; svn-commit.foo
mv svn-commit.foo svn-commit.tmp
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDITOR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; svn-commit.tmp
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using this method, running &lt;code&gt;svn commit&lt;/code&gt; will pull up your text editor
with &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;: username&amp;#8221; already inserted in the commit&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="subversion"></category><category term="svn"></category></entry><entry><title>Puppet problems with hostname in autosign.conf - Invalid pattern</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/10/puppet-problems-with-hostname-in-autosignconf-invalid-pattern/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-10-14T14:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-10-14:2009/10/puppet-problems-with-hostname-in-autosignconf-invalid-pattern/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In playing with Puppet (0.24.8 on clients and server) today (well,
building a new host) I came by a strange error when I ran puppet on the&amp;nbsp;client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;err: Could not request certificate: Certificate retrieval failed: Invalid pattern css-storemanager
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing that was so strange is that &amp;#8220;css-storemanager&amp;#8221; is the name of
a host at my site, controlled by Puppet, but it has nothing to do with
the host I was building. They&amp;#8217;re different boxes, on different subnets,
in different rooms. One is a SunFire and the other is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google turned up nothing. Running puppetmasterd with &lt;code&gt;--debug --trace&lt;/code&gt;
yielded:&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vg"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;begin&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@pattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;IPAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;rescue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ArgumentError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;detail&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;AuthStoreError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Invalid pattern %s&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ip&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Following the trace back, I took a look at
&lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/network/handler/ca.rb&lt;/code&gt; starting at
line&amp;nbsp;50:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;            &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;Puppet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;AuthStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;autosign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^\s*#/&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^\s*$/&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chomp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After looking at this, it clicked that it must be what evaluates
autosign.conf. Taking a look at mine, one line stood out: a line
containing only &amp;#8220;css-storemanager&amp;#8221;, not a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FQDN&lt;/span&gt; like all the rest. The
parse() function in authstore.rb only accepts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses and FQDNs (or
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses ending in a wildcard, or wildcard FQDNs). It appears to
choke on hostnames (a string that doesn&amp;#8217;t match an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FQDN&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;).
Interestingly, it also evaluates in order, and stops evaluating
autosign.conf once it finds a match. So, if you&amp;#8217;re a Bad Person like me,
and left autosign turned on for all of your hosts, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t notice
this until you try and build a new&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this, just remove any offending lines from&amp;nbsp;autosign.conf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve filed a bug report on the Puppet Trac: &lt;a href="http://projects.reductivelabs.com/issues/2723"&gt;Issue
2723&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="autosign.conf"></category><category term="hostname"></category><category term="puppet"></category></entry><entry><title>Project Announcement - PHPsa</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/09/project-announcement-phpsa/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-09-29T15:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-09-29:2009/09/project-announcement-phpsa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; scoop on the new project that I&amp;#8217;m
planning/starting to work on. I&amp;#8217;m calling it PHPsa for now, and it&amp;#8217;s
going to (hopefully) be an integrated dashboard/portal for SysAdmins.
While there are a number of tools that fit into this general category
(perhaps with &lt;a href="http://www.alienvault.com/home.php?section=News"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSSIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
being the closest, though it&amp;#8217;s security-minded), I feel that there&amp;#8217;s a
real gap in terms of tool integration. My daily workflow, which includes
multiple trips to and correlation among Nagios, Cacti, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;,
Puppet, logs, and other tools really leaves something to be desired. So,
I&amp;#8217;m setting out to create a modular SysAdmin dashboard that unifies many
of the common SysAdmin-related tools into a modular&amp;nbsp;dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first overall design goals that I&amp;#8217;ve set&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modular, plugin-based architecture that allows admins to select
    which features/tools they want, and allows easy development of new&amp;nbsp;modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with legacy tools in mind - easy ways to tie in to tools that
    weren&amp;#8217;t written with PHPsa in mind, both in terms of linking to
    information and gathering/unifying&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBAC&lt;/span&gt;, including per-module rules and the possibility for a limited
    read-only view (client/user&amp;nbsp;mode).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of data sources, specifically web-based/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; APIs where
    available, and databases otherwise, from existing tools with as
    little modification as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for database abstraction, though I&amp;#8217;ll be using&amp;nbsp;MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, implement &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds of pertinent&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Ajax/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHTML&lt;/span&gt; with the desire for important things to have
    canonical, static, bookmark-able&amp;nbsp;URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are some of the things that I&amp;#8217;m planning on integrating, with
obvious bias towards getting my own projects done before I integrate
pre-existing&amp;nbsp;tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://multibindadmin.jasonantman.com"&gt;MultiBindAdmin&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; and
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; administration tool (specifically geared towards split-view &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;
    with the inside view behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rackman.jasonantman.com/"&gt;RackMan&lt;/a&gt;, my tool for mapping
    devices&amp;#8217; physical locations in racks (and tacking&amp;nbsp;patching).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My simple config tool for
    &lt;a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nagios.org/"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cacti.net/"&gt;Cacti&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt; (monitoring/status&amp;nbsp;only).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syslog via &lt;a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/"&gt;rsyslog&lt;/a&gt; (or any other
    syslog-to-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;solution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly a front-end to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
    Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of my custom scripts for graphing SpamAssassin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; queries,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of Apache log analysis, like
    &lt;a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/"&gt;Webalizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail log analysis, possibly
    &lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first big issues that I&amp;#8217;m going to&amp;nbsp;tackle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General layout. Specifically, how to handle a more-or-less
    consistent layout while integrating tools that weren&amp;#8217;t designed for
    PHPsa. I&amp;#8217;ll probably end up using iFrames (or even a frameset) for
    tools that don&amp;#8217;t integrate&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to correlate data/objects between different tools (i.e. how to
    display information from Nagios, Cacti, MultiBindAdmin and MachDB
    for a given&amp;nbsp;host?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to use a templating engine like
    &lt;a href="http://www.smarty.net/"&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt; or hand-code all of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I handle&amp;nbsp;plugins?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much code do I want to re-write and how much can I use as-is
    from other tools? And, on a related note, how much existing data can
    I access easily from other tools, vs having to use grabber scripts
    that dump data in&amp;nbsp;MySQL?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2010-02-03&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this may become a semi-official project
for me at $work, which means that I&amp;#8217;ll be able to dedicate quite a bit
more time to it. Unfortunately, it also means that I will, most likely,
have to give up Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt; in
favor of &lt;a href="http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCS&lt;/span&gt; Inventory &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a more
mature project that already includes inventory support for Linux,
Windows and&amp;nbsp;Mac.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bind"></category><category term="cacti"></category><category term="dns"></category><category term="Nagios"></category><category term="PHPsa"></category><category term="Projects"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="rsyslog"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category><category term="syslog"></category></entry><entry><title>Building a Rebuild-able Site</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/05/building-a-rebuild-able-site/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-05-06T08:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-05-06:2009/05/building-a-rebuild-able-site/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORK&lt;/span&gt;, my group runs about two dozen servers that provide services
for over 60,000 users. They&amp;#8217;re a mix of Windows and Linux, with some old
Solaris stuff thrown in there. The one thing they have in common is
they&amp;#8217;re all hand-built, hand-configured, and old. They&amp;#8217;ve been around
for a while. At the moment, we don&amp;#8217;t even have an adequate backup&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, being the closest thing to a SysAdmin we have (my official title is
still Student Systems Programmer), it&amp;#8217;s my job to build a new
installation, configuration and backup infrastructure. We&amp;#8217;ve already
standardized on &lt;a href="http://www.centos.org"&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; as a University-wide
distro, and have a local full mirror, so I don&amp;#8217;t need to choose a
distro. I do, however, have to plan the installation and backup
architecture. The main requirements&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest overall time for bare-metal recovery to a working&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of use, as people other than myself will need to administer it
    (so they should be able to do so from a cheat sheet in the&amp;nbsp;wiki).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatability - it should be easy and intuitive to make an
    almost-exact-copy of a&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a thread a few days ago on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt; mailing list, which you
can find
&lt;a href="http://mailman.sage.org/pipermail/sage-members/2009/msg00447.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, it looks like the general idea that I&amp;#8217;m going with is to
use &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart"&gt;Kickstart&lt;/a&gt; to
install the systems, using a basic and minimal Kickstart file. Basic
package selection (minimalist) with just what&amp;#8217;s needed to configure the
system with a hostname and network settings for the management &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ll then have Kickstart install and configure a configuration
management package - I&amp;#8217;m leaning towards
&lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; over
&lt;a href="http://www.cfengine.org/"&gt;Cfengine&lt;/a&gt; and am starting testing. The config
management software will handle all of the customization for the system
(everything different from the base generic Kickstart install) so it&amp;#8217;s
all kept under the control of config management from step&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part is a backup system, mainly for whatever eventually -
whether out of human error or simple laziness - ends up out of the
config management system&amp;#8217;s control. Our previous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; had settled on
&lt;a href="http://www.zmanda.com/"&gt;Zmanda&lt;/a&gt;, the paid version of
&lt;a href="http://www.amanda.org/"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with specific plugins for
MySQL and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSSQL&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m also looking at &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt;,
mainly because of its&amp;#8217; advanced features, scheduling (especially the new
scheduling in Bacula 3) and&amp;nbsp;scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty that I see in having Kickstart do something minimal and then
letting Puppet handle the rest is that (especially since we&amp;#8217;ve
standardized on SunFire X4100&amp;#8217;s with identical configurations) I can
kickstart and rack up a few spare machines, and to get them up and
running all I need to do is power them up (iLOM) and tell Puppet what to
make&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently starting testing of both Puppet itself and getting
Kickstart to start the puppet install and daemon (instructions from
&lt;a href="http://watzmann.net/blog/index.php?cat=21"&gt;David Lutterkort&amp;#8217;s blog (Red Hat software
engineer)&lt;/a&gt;). We&amp;#8217;ll see how
everything&amp;nbsp;goes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="backup"></category><category term="configuration"></category><category term="kickstart"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="recovery"></category><category term="work"></category></entry></feed>
