&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a lot of work on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; HomeAssistant-based home automation and security system since my &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/"&gt;last post on it&lt;/a&gt; just over a month ago. While it was a lot of work and frustrating at times, I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that I think I&amp;#8217;ve finally gotten everything to a usable and working state, and I don&amp;#8217;t currently have anything left on my to-do list for this project. I have four working security cameras that run both motion detection and object detection and notify me if a person is detected, a functional alarm system for unauthorized entry, and a few home automation&amp;nbsp;conveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all of the code and configuration backing this is available in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs"&gt;home-automation-configs GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; but I want to use this post to go over each of the major components as well as some of the difficulties I&amp;nbsp;encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="security-cameras"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#security-cameras"&gt;Security&amp;nbsp;Cameras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I purchased the two more security cameras I&amp;#8217;d been thinking about, a pair of WiFi  &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt; 1080P with a super-wide 128º field of view. After switching out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W (960P / 92º FoV) on my front porch for one of them and mounting the other on the far side of the house, I now have a total of four cameras (three outside, one inside) and coverage of both entrances to my house and all meaningful approaches to the&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;#8217;t take into account, unfortunately, was the signal strength from my aged (in-service 24x7 for ) 2.4GHz Ubiquiti Networks access point at the far corners of the house. After a sweaty, hot summer afternoon up on a ladder mounting a camera at the back corner of the house and attempting in vain to aim it using the stream over WiFi, I realized that the construction of my (rental) house causes severe signal shadows at the back corners. I spent a fruitless few hours trying to set up a Netgear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WN3000RP&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;WiFi Range Extender&amp;#8221; that I picked up at Best Buy (the setup process was horribly frustrating and error-prone even for someone who worked as a wireless network engineer) only to realize that it was actually a layer 3 router and nothing connected to the extended network could be accessed from my&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending another afternoon considering some options - moving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; or adding another, neither very feasible in a rented house that I don&amp;#8217;t want to run permanent cabling in - I ended up using existing holes and wiring paths to hook up both cameras with wired Ethernet. In retrospect, I should have done either a proper wireless site survey or at least some spot tests with my phone or laptop beforehand. It would&amp;#8217;ve been much faster if I&amp;#8217;d known about the poor signal beforehand, and I also would&amp;#8217;ve purchased PoE cameras instead of using the WiFi models which ended up requiring both Ethernet and power cables. On that note, my one complaint so far about the Amcrest cameras is that they are &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; wired Ethernet with PoE &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; WiFi with separate Ethernet and 12V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; power cables. I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure why they were designed this way as opposed to all supporting PoE, but I assume there&amp;#8217;s a manufacturing or cost&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have noticed in the past month of having both wireless and wired cameras is the difference in frame rate. While my one outdoor camera that&amp;#8217;s actually using the 2.4GHz WiFi works acceptably well, ZoneMinder is all too happy to show me that it runs at between five and nine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPS&lt;/span&gt;, whereas the indoor WiFi and outdoor wired cameras run at the full configured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;10FPS&lt;/span&gt; rate. If I had to do the camera installation over again, I would&amp;#8217;ve spent much more time assessing the 2.4GHz coverage around my house from my existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; and likely considered PoE cameras for all of the outdoor&amp;nbsp;locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="neural-network-object-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;Neural Network Object&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; how I started passing still images from motion events through &lt;a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/"&gt;Joseph Redmon&amp;#8217;s Darknet yolo3&lt;/a&gt; neural network object detection library. With some caveats this has worked out extremely well. While I&amp;#8217;ve decided that my cameras are mainly for remote monitoring and possible evidentiary value, and not really for use as an alarm, I&amp;#8217;m still pushing notifications from them to my phone when my alarm is armed; I&amp;#8217;m just not relying on them as a primary means of detecting a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One down side to my current setup is the &amp;#8220;tiny&amp;#8221; version of the yolov3 model that I&amp;#8217;m forced to use because of my poor choice of graphics card. I got the feeling that the performance of the tiny model was significantly worse than the full version and, sure enough, comparison tests on the same images proved that. It seems reasonably good at detecting people, but has a relatively high number of false positives. To compensate for this, I&amp;#8217;ve built functionality to ignore certain objects in certain locations in to my image processing scripts; I can now easily log but ignore when yolo detects a stump in my front yard as a cow, or my porch railing as a&amp;nbsp;bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current code for handling ZoneMinder events, available &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/tree/master/zoneminder"&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt; implements what seems to me to be a reasonable workflow for my needs. When events are detected by ZoneMinder a selection of frames - first, last, and a variable number of high-motion (high-score) frames - are passed through yolov3-tiny object detection. Using the tiny model and 1920x1080 frames, this takes about 1/4 second per frame on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. Once a list of detections is obtained (category, confidence level, and bounding boxes for each detected object) it parses the Notes field on the ZoneMinder event to determine what zones motion was detected in, then retrieves the coordinates of each zone on the monitor form ZoneMinder and calculates which zones contain each detected object. All of that information is used to evaluate - via a configuration file - which objects should be ignored. All of this information - the ZoneMinder Event details, object detections and their containing zones, etc. - is passed to HomeAssistant as an event, where it&amp;#8217;s picked up by an AppDaemon&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tie-in-with-alarm-system"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#tie-in-with-alarm-system"&gt;Tie-In with Alarm&amp;nbsp;System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ZoneMinder events/alarms are sent to HomeAssistant as events they&amp;#8217;re picked up by an AppDaemon app, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/master/appdaemon/apps/zmevent_alarm_handler.py"&gt;zmevent_alarm_handler.py&lt;/a&gt;. This handles the logic behind whether or not to send me a notification for a given ZoneMinder alarm. The logic I&amp;#8217;m currently using is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If my alarm system is disarmed, no&amp;nbsp;notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no objects were detected by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOLO3&lt;/span&gt;, no&amp;nbsp;notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the only motion was in the &amp;#8220;Street&amp;#8221; zones, no notification. I have distinct zones for the road in front of my property, and record motion there but don&amp;#8217;t alert on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate a short string describing the objects detected and what zones they&amp;#8217;re in, for use in&amp;nbsp;notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an &lt;code&gt;input_boolean&lt;/code&gt; in HomeAssistant called &amp;#8220;silence_cameras&amp;#8221; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on, send a Pushover notification to my phone containing the description of the alert and the highest-motion frame containing the detected&amp;nbsp;object(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send an email containing all analyzed/detected frames as well as the full details of the&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this is working quite well for me. I get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few false positives with the above logic combined with object detection, only get notified if my alarm system is armed, and as far as I can tell get notified 100% of the time a person is on my&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="alarm-system"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alarm-system"&gt;Alarm&amp;nbsp;System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My traditional alarm system hasn&amp;#8217;t changed much since my last post. I have door/window sensors on both entry doors to the house as well as the gate to my fenced yard and the door on the crawlspace under the house. I&amp;#8217;ve added motion detectors in most rooms, but because of problems with the sensors I chose (more on that below) I only have one in use as a trigger for the alarm, a more reliable model than the other four I purchased. With the addition of a physical control panel near the front door (more on that below as well) it&amp;#8217;s working quite well for me. I&amp;#8217;ve had zero false positives so far, and a 100% detection rate based on HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s logs of the sensors (and my own occasional forgetting to disarm the system before I open a door). There&amp;#8217;s still something to be desired in terms of reliability of notifications as it relies on my cable Internet connection, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get notified within five minutes by offsite monitoring if my Internet connection goes down. If I really wanted more than that, I&amp;#8217;d look into some sort of cellular backup&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall functionality of the system is incredibly basic: when armed (&lt;code&gt;input_select&lt;/code&gt; in HomeAssistant) and one of the sensors is tripped, it pushes a loud high-priority notification to my phone via Pushover. I opted not to use HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s state machine-based &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/alarm_control_panel.manual/"&gt;manual alarm control panel&lt;/a&gt; component and rather implement my own logic in AppDaemon. I have an &lt;code&gt;input_select&lt;/code&gt; with three options: Disarmed, Home and Away. The alarm does nothing in &amp;#8220;Disarmed&amp;#8221; state. The &amp;#8220;Home&amp;#8221; state uses only external (door/window) sensors for trigger and the &amp;#8220;Away&amp;#8221; state also includes interior motion sensors. This trinary state is also used to control whether ZoneMinder events notify me, as described previously. My logic doesn&amp;#8217;t include any &amp;#8220;triggered&amp;#8221; state or delay; I get one notification for every sensor trigger. It also doesn&amp;#8217;t include any arming delay, but since I built and installed a real physical control panel near the door, it includes a configurable delay (currently 10 seconds) to give me time to disarm before triggering the alarm if it&amp;#8217;s currently in the Away&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One added bit of fancy-ness that I put into the alarm is integration with ZoneMinder and my cameras. All of the doors (as well as the fence gate) have external coverage by outdoor cameras, and the front and back doors also share internal coverage from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTZ&lt;/span&gt; camera mounted in view of both of them. When the alarm is armed and a door sensor trips, the AppDaemon app that handles the alarm captures images from whatever cameras have a view of the door that opened (including panning the indoor camera if needed). Those images are included in the Pushover notification that I receive, making it much more informative than just knowing that a particular door&amp;nbsp;opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zooz-multi-sensors"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#zooz-multi-sensors"&gt;Zooz&amp;nbsp;Multi-Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post I &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;d purchased some Z-Wave security sensors, including a $40 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQXXG0I/"&gt;EcoLink &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIRZWAVE2&lt;/span&gt;.5-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Z-Wave Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensor &amp;#8220;with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PET&lt;/span&gt; immunity&amp;#8221; (I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure they mean domestic animals, not Positron Emission Tomography). I originally just set it to lowest sensitivity (via a physical jumper) and balanced it on top of the blinds in my living room to see how it worked. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it seemed to work perfectly - it triggered every time I moved in the room, and never when no person was in the room. After a week or so I decided that it was working well enough to order some more for full coverage of my house. I put the EcoLink &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; sensor in the back room that I use for storage and the cats&amp;#8217; food and litter boxes, and in the month-plus since then it&amp;#8217;s had a 100% accuracy&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began shopping for four more sensors, though, I was tempted to see if I could find something a bit less expensive. As I&amp;#8217;d just gotten my Z-Wave thermostat working, I was really intrigued by the $36 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AKSO80O/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZOOZ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZSE40&lt;/span&gt; 4-in-1 sensor, version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; which combines a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensor with sensors for light, temperature, and humidity. I figured these would let me save a tiny bit of money while also getting the bonus of temperature sensors in every room, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensors have seven levels of sensitivity - settable over Z-Wave - which I figured would be more than enough to get them to ignore my&amp;nbsp;cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zooz sensors only had a 3.5 star rating on Amazon and lots of negative reviews, but it seemed that most of the reviews were for the older (non-2.0) version. Unfortunately I didn&amp;#8217;t heed my concerns and bought four of them, and I&amp;#8217;ve regretted that ever since. Setting them up initially was nowhere near as simple as the EcoLink products, since they&amp;#8217;d usually end up going to sleep before they completed pairing with my Z-Wave controller. The same was true of their seven-level sensitivity; each change required me to run around the house with a laptop and paperclip, setting the sensitivity I wanted and then waking the device up with the paperclip. This often required multiple cycles per sensor until the setting change took. Lastly, and most importantly, the machine I have running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; and my Z-Wave network went offline for about six hours a few weeks ago. All of my other battery-operated sensors came back online within 30 minutes of getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; up and running again, but these took up to four hours to come back even after manually waking them&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of that, even on the lowest of the seven sensitivity levels, my cats still set them off. The motion sensing is adequate for controlling lights, but causes false alarms quite often for security purposes. I&amp;#8217;ve only had them for about a month and a half, but one of the four is now completely dead - it won&amp;#8217;t even blink when I replace the battery. The temperature sensors are adequate, but not terribly accurate and suffer from serious lag problems. The light sensors function but report in &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; instead of any actual measurement of light and the scale seems poorly calibrated for indoor use unless the sensor is pointed directly at the dominant light source. The sensor in my kitchen (which is pointed almost directly at the ceiling fixture) reads near 80% with the light on, about 60% with the light off during the day, and about 20% with the light off at night. However, the sensor in my bedroom reads about 2% when dark at night and only increases to about 10% with the light on during the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, I was tempted by the prospect of being able to get motion, temperature, and light level sensors all in one package and for a really low price. I ended up getting what I paid for - a $10 motion sensor, $10 temperature sensor, and $10 light level sensor. If I had to do it over again (or, when I eventually do) I&amp;#8217;d get more of the EcoLink motion sensors and add some dedicated temperature/light sensors where I need&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="control-panel"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#control-panel"&gt;Control&amp;nbsp;Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using my alarm system for a few weeks, it was clear to me that relying on proximity detection of my phone (updated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; using the &lt;a href="https://gpslogger.app/"&gt;GPSLogger app&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; web interface to arm and disarm wasn&amp;#8217;t going to work. The presence detection often didn&amp;#8217;t update fast enough if I was driving to or from my house and disarming via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; just took way too long - especially since my phone connecting to WiFi when I get home causes problems with this. After giving it some thought, I decided to build a physical alarm control panel. I did some quick proofs-of-concept using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; WebSocket &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and Javascript served by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; itself, and an AppDaemon app to handle the logic. It&amp;#8217;s not pretty, but it gives me a working interface that handled my main&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of the lights in the&amp;nbsp;room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arming in either Home or Away modes, with a configurable delay for arming in Away (and ensuring all external door sensors are closed before&amp;nbsp;arming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-touch diarming from Home&amp;nbsp;state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code-entry disarming from Away state, with a configurable delay between sensor activation and alarm&amp;nbsp;trigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the software side of that working locally on my desktop computer, I decided that I&amp;#8217;d use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that I already had for the control panel. I ordered a simple 320x480 3.5-inch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TFT&lt;/span&gt; touchscreen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FXC5ECS/"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B5YG4LC/"&gt;decent case&lt;/a&gt; for the Pi and screen, for about $46 total. Assembly and getting the software up and running was pretty easy (my notes are &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/master/doorpanels.md"&gt;on GitHub here&lt;/a&gt;) and I had it up and running in an hour or so. This has really helped make the alarm more usable, since I have the touchscreen near my front door and can just tap a button to arm on my way out the door, and have fifteen seconds to enter a code when I get&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few photos of the finished unit currently hanging out on top of the entertainment center in my living room, just a few feet inside the front&amp;nbsp;door:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="home-automation"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#home-automation"&gt;Home&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t delved too deep into the home automation side of things yet, and am going to try not to go overboard with it. The Z-Wave thermostat &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#thermostat"&gt;that I mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt; is working well, but unfortunately the undersized and poorly-installed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HVAC&lt;/span&gt; system in my poorly-insulated house renders it largely moot; in the summer heat the air conditioning can&amp;#8217;t keep up anyway so there&amp;#8217;s little need for me to change the thermostat. I do have motion-activated lights in my kitchen which has proved quite convenient and satisfying, and I&amp;#8217;ve also set up some automations around my front porch light to automatically turn it on when the front door opens and it&amp;#8217;s dark outside and to turn it on just before I arrive home when I&amp;#8217;m away from the house at night. I&amp;#8217;ve also set up an automation in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; to detect when I first turn on my bedroom light in the morning, and automatically disarm the alarm and turn on the kitchen and living room lights. I&amp;#8217;m going to try and make this the end of my home automation experiment, but I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll give in and add a few more pieces over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="amcrest"></category><category term="camera"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="surveillance"></category><category term="video"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="IP camera"></category><category term="evaluation"></category><category term="alarm"></category><category term="IR"></category><category term="homeassistant"></category><category term="hass"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="z-wave"></category><category term="darknet"></category><category term="yolo"></category><category term="machine learning"></category><category term="neural network"></category><category term="object detection"></category></entry><entry><title>Better Logging for AppDaemon Apps</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/07/better-logging-for-appdaemon-apps/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-15T07:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-15T07:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-07-15:/2018/07/better-logging-for-appdaemon-apps/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A small Python class I wrote to give AppDaemon apps more Pythonic&amp;nbsp;logging.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I briefly mentioned in my last post, &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera, Home Security and Automation Update&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve begun using the &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt; project for home automation and also to act as the brain for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; alarm system. The logic behind some of this is somewhat complex, so rather than try to use HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;-based automation configuration for all of it, I&amp;#8217;ve implemented the alarm logic using AppDaemon. &lt;a href="http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;AppDaemon&lt;/a&gt; is a Python daemon that integrates with HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and message/event bus, and allows standalone Python classes (&amp;#8220;apps&amp;#8221;) to operate like HomeAssistant automations - be triggered by events or state change, access internal state and attributes, call services, and control anything that HomeAssistant can control. For someone with at least a basic working knowledge of Python, this makes it much easier to write complex conditional logic than attempting to use&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I wrote my first AppDaemon app, I was quite frustrated by the built-in logging system. The &lt;a href="http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/APPGUIDE.html#writing-to-logfiles"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains that AppDaemon uses two log files by default, &amp;#8220;general&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;error&amp;#8221;, and that each AppDaemon app (subclass of &lt;code&gt;appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi.Hass&lt;/code&gt;) can log to them using &lt;code&gt;self.log()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;self.error()&lt;/code&gt; convenience methods. So far this sounds fine. However, looking at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation for these &lt;a href="http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/APIREFERENCE.html#log"&gt;log()&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/APIREFERENCE.html#error"&gt;error()&lt;/a&gt; methods, it becomes apparent that the only arguments they take are a string &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; and a log level that defaults to &lt;code&gt;INFO&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike the ubiquitous logging methods of the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logger-objects"&gt;Python standard library&lt;/a&gt;, they don&amp;#8217;t accept a message with percent-formatting placeholders and a list of arguments, meaning that the message string needs to be formatted in the logging call&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another annoyance is the fixed logging format that includes only the timestamp, log level, app name, and message; when I&amp;#8217;m developing and debugging code I often find it useful to include at least the source module and line number in the log message. At first I tried to alter the logging formatter in use by AppDaemon, but that gave some strange results because it turns out that AppDaemon doesn&amp;#8217;t actually use a logging format, but rather in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/blob/e04820aafafe840fb4be7a8bef1996b70e62506f/appdaemon/utils.py#L143-L160"&gt;appdaemon.utils.log()&lt;/a&gt; function interpolates the timestamp, level and app name directly into the message and passes that to&amp;nbsp;logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, and even more bothersome during development, there&amp;#8217;s no way to enable debug-level logging on a per-app basis. Logging level is controlled by a command line flag (&lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;appdaemon&lt;/code&gt; itself, which means that debug logging is all-or-nothing for both AppDaemon itself and all apps. I found a &lt;a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/appdaemon-debug-mode/9703"&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; complaining about this and also a &lt;a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/appdaemon/issues/45"&gt;closed GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; looking for a better&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I came up with my own solution to this in the form of my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/9c196f1e552fc9fbdfe15f2e27a7275bca24f167/appdaemon/apps/sane_app_logging.py"&gt;sane_app_logging.py&lt;/a&gt; module and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/9c196f1e552fc9fbdfe15f2e27a7275bca24f167/appdaemon/apps/sane_app_logging.py"&gt;SaneAppLogging&lt;/a&gt; mixin class in it. All I need to do is add &lt;code&gt;SaneAppLogging&lt;/code&gt; to the list of classes my app inherits from and add a call to &lt;code&gt;self._setup_logging(self.__class__.__name__, False)&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;initialize()&lt;/code&gt; method. What this gets me&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;self._log.(debug|info|warning|error|critical|log)&lt;/code&gt; methods that pass directly through to the standard library logging methods, including args and kwargs (and therefore support for log messages with percent-formatting of&amp;nbsp;args).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log message formatting for all of AppDaemon that includes the filename, line number and function name (&lt;code&gt;"[%(levelname)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)s - %(name)s.%(funcName)s() ] %(message)s"&lt;/code&gt;). A large portion of the code in my &lt;code&gt;sane_app_logging.py&lt;/code&gt; module is dedicated to finding the proper stack frame so that source location is correct even with the wrapper in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runtime&lt;/em&gt; toggling of &amp;#8220;debug-as-info&amp;#8221; logging. To get around AppDaemon&amp;#8217;s global log levels and the requirement of enabling debugging at AppDaemon start and for all running code, apps using &lt;code&gt;SaneAppLogging&lt;/code&gt; listen for a &lt;code&gt;LOGWRAPPER_SET_DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; event from HomeAssistant. When received this event toggles a specific app class to log all &lt;code&gt;.debug()&lt;/code&gt; messages at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt; level instead, allowing me to selectively turn on and off debug logging on a single app at&amp;nbsp;runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event payloads for debug-as-info toggling are quite simple, a dictionary with two keys: &lt;code&gt;app_class&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;debug_value&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;app_class&lt;/code&gt; should be set to the name of the class (App) we want to change, and &lt;code&gt;debug_value&lt;/code&gt; a boolean. When True, any messages logged via &lt;code&gt;self._log.debug()&lt;/code&gt; will &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/9c196f1e552fc9fbdfe15f2e27a7275bca24f167/appdaemon/apps/sane_app_logging.py#L100-L102"&gt;actually be logged&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;self._log.info()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this seems to be working quite well for me, and allowing me to have a much better experience with developing, debugging and testing AppDaemon apps. Perhaps it will be useful to someone else as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="AppDaemon"></category><category term="HomeAssistant"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="logging"></category></entry><entry><title>IP Camera, Home Security and Automation Update</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-02T06:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-02T06:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-07-02:/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An update on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; camera and home security project, now branching out into home automation and machine learning as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="toc"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I posted about my &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/"&gt;Linux Surveillance Camera Software Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; and my plans for turning some Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; cameras into a home security system. I&amp;#8217;ve made a lot of progress and some big changes since then and decided that I had better post an update before the effort of doing so becomes overwhelming. There are a lot of changes and new information, and some really cool plans for the future (this has become my new obsession, albeit a prohibitively expensive one), so I&amp;#8217;ll break this up into a number of&amp;nbsp;sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amcrest-cameras"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#amcrest-cameras"&gt;Amcrest&amp;nbsp;Cameras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m extremely happy with the two Amcrest cameras I purchased, and am planning to add two more at some point in the near future to cover the rest of the exterior of my house. The one I currently have outside is an Amcrest &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-1-3mp-bullt-wifi-video-security-ip-camera-pt-ipm-723w.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W&lt;/a&gt; WiFi camera with a 1.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;3MP&lt;/span&gt; 1280x960 resolution and a 92º field of view. It&amp;#8217;s a decent camera and the resolution is perfectly adequate but I wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind a bit more, and more importantly, both sides of my house would benefit a lot from a winder field of view. I believe I&amp;#8217;ve settled on two Amcrest &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt;, which are similar outdoor WiFi cameras but with 1920x1080 resolution and a super-wide 128º field of&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received some questions via email after writing this post about the Amcrest cameras with Linux as well as the security of them. I think I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with both, but both with some caveats. First of all, regarding security, I&amp;#8217;m skeptical of the security of any proprietary software (especially from a small vendor or one not in the software business) and generally expect all IoT devices to have abysmal security. When I originally purchased the devices, I blocked all Internet-bound traffic from them at my router before even plugging them in. For the time being at least, I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that to be enough for my needs. I certainly wouldn&amp;#8217;t expose these directly to the Internet or allow them to access both the Internet and my home network, as is the case for any consumer-oriented&amp;nbsp;devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also received some questions about the Linux support for Amcrest cameras. My experience so far has been consistent with my &lt;a href="/2018/05/amcrest-ip-camera-first-impressions/"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera First Impressions - Jason Antman&amp;#8217;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;. The cameras certainly work fine under Linux in general; they can be fully controlled and configured via any browser and you can view the low-resolution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream in any browser. Viewing the full-resolution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTSP&lt;/span&gt; stream requires either the Amcrest Web View Chrome app or a viewer that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTSP&lt;/span&gt; streams (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLC&lt;/span&gt; or any common surveillance camera software). Aside from watching the stream in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLC&lt;/span&gt; or Amcrest Web View while I was outside aiming the camera, I&amp;#8217;ve been using either the low-res &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream in a browser or, more recently ZoneMinder and HomeAssistant, to view it. Unless you want a closed-source native desktop app, I can&amp;#8217;t find any meaningful difference between how the cameras work on Linux vs Mac or presumably&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ir-illuminator"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#ir-illuminator"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Illuminator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first step in attempting to reduce false-positive motion detection caused by flying bugs at night was purchasing an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; illuminator. I opted for a 12V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; model on amazon that uses the same power supply as the camera (I purchased a splitter for them), the
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G6EDOO2/"&gt;Univivi 850nm 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; Wide Angle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; Illuminator&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a large-ish unit that looks much like a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; floodlight, except that when on it emits only a barely-visible red glow from the LEDs. This has helped immensely; I have it placed about a foot and a half away from the camera and it has dramatically cut down on (but not eliminated) the number of times that the motion detection is triggered at night by moths and other light-seeking insects. That being said, with some of the advances I&amp;#8217;ve made in other areas (read on) I probably won&amp;#8217;t be replicating this for my other cameras, at least not initially. I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; also remark that the light output from this unit isn&amp;#8217;t wide enough to cover the camera&amp;#8217;s whole field of view, and it does suffer from some definite hot&amp;nbsp;spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a view of the camera and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; illuminator during the&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/ir_illuminator_day.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="camera and IR illuminator as installed, during the day" src="/GFX/ir_illuminator_day_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s a view of it at night. Note that this was taken in almost total darkness and to the human eye the illuminator only emits a barely-visible red glow; unfortunately this photo does more to illustrate how sensitive my phone camera is to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; than what it actually looks&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/ir_illuminator_night.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="camera and IR illuminator at night" src="/GFX/ir_illuminator_night_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="surveillance-software-zoneminder"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#surveillance-software-zoneminder"&gt;Surveillance Software -&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I last posted I&amp;#8217;d done an &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/"&gt;evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of a number of options for Linux-based video surveillance, discounted ZoneMinder mainly because of its age, resource requirements, and difficulty getting it running in Docker. I ended up settling on the &lt;a href="https://motion-project.github.io/"&gt;Motion Project&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt;) because of its simplicity and low resource requirements. Unfortunately, that path ended up being a dead&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of time tuning motion and developing a horribly simple proof-of-concept web interface for it (the defunct project lives at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/motion-pipeline"&gt;https://github.com/jantman/motion-pipeline&lt;/a&gt; if anyone is interested) and playing with masks and various values to get reliable motion detection at 1920x1080 10fps on a RaspberryPi 3B+. While I eventually got that working including notifications with images, it failed completely when I installed the camera in its final environment - the exterior of my house. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get the motion detection to capture legitimate events but ignore the large amounts of shadow motion when wind caught the trees around my house. I hadn&amp;#8217;t considered this relatively obvious issue when I did my initial tests at my former (and relatively tree-free) apartment complex. It&amp;#8217;s also worth noting that when running motion detection at 1920x1080 10fps, the RaspberryPi 3B+ was essentially at its limits; if I wanted to add another camera of equal resolution and frame rate I&amp;#8217;d need a Pi per&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that non-starter I remembered that the motion detection algorithm in &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt; only takes luminance into account (effectively a black-and-white image) but ZoneMinder uses full color in its motion detection. So, I decided to take another look at ZoneMinder. After some initial hiccups I decided to just install the &lt;code&gt;zoneminder&lt;/code&gt; package on the RaspberryPi 3B+ running Debian 9. After a bit of setup, I had it running and processing 1920x1080 10fps on the Pi. This taxed the system quite a bit and the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; was almost unusably sluggish, but it was enough for me to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; up and running and to prove that its motion detection algorithm handles clouds and shadows &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was apparent that if I wanted to make use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; with multiple cameras and also have it be useful and reliable, I needed significantly better hardware than the RaspberryPi. After some searching on Amazon, I found a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWP82CK/"&gt;refurbished &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Elite 8200 small-form-factor desktop&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for $300. It was quite a bit more money than I&amp;#8217;d wanted to put into this system, but with an Intel Core i7-2600 with four cores (plus hyper-threading) at 3.4GHz, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; memory and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2TB&lt;/span&gt; spinning disk, I figured it would be more than adequate for four or more cameras (in fact the specs are shockingly close to my desktop computer, which was quite beefy when I built it three or four years&amp;nbsp;ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That machine arrived two weeks ago and I installed Debian 9 on it along with the official ZoneMinder package, and it&amp;#8217;s performing amazingly well. With one camera at 1920x1080 10fps in monitor mode and another at 1280x960 10fps in motion detection (Modect) mode, the system barely breaks a sweat with half of its memory free and half or three-quarters of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; cores idle. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; is performing exceedingly well, with the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; fast and streaming working very well. I&amp;#8217;m still having some false positives from shadows when it gets very windy, but I have a plan for addressing that as well. Overall I&amp;#8217;m really glad I switched to ZoneMinder with decent hardware, and plan on further improving and expanding this set-up in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notifications"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#notifications"&gt;Notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that ZoneMinder completely lacks is the built-in ability to notify immediately on new events/alarms. The closest that it has are &amp;#8220;filters&amp;#8221;, which run at a configurable interval (usually 60 seconds) and can be set to send email or execute an external command for new alarms. Unfortunately there are some issues around how they&amp;#8217;re configured that result in either notification storms or severe delays when multiple short events happen in rapid succession. After using this method for a few days and researching other possibilities, I found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventserver"&gt;zmeventserver&lt;/a&gt; project, a daemon written in Perl that polls the ZoneMinder shared memory map for new events at a short interval and pushes them to clients via a websocket server. After some initial experimentation, I unashamedly hacked up the Perl source, ripped out the websocket server, and modified it to execute a shell command with the event &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; as an argument (backgrounded with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; so as not to tie up the Perl&amp;nbsp;code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my event handler script I wrote something in Python that grabs the details of the event directly from ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s database, along with the first and best (most motion) frames, and sends them to me via email and Pushover. I&amp;#8217;ve added a bit more to the script but it&amp;#8217;s still quite a hack-ish proof-of-concept and too rough to share, but there&amp;#8217;s really nothing terribly complicated about it: it gets called with ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s EventId, looks up that event and a bunch of related stuff in the database, and then generates an email and Pushover notification. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;m going to keep using this or try to push most of the logic into HomeAssistant (see below); if I do stick with this script, I&amp;#8217;ll make an effort to clean it up and publish the&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="image-processing-ir-switch-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#image-processing-ir-switch-detection"&gt;Image Processing - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; Switch&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got ZoneMinder relatively well tuned for motion detection in my environment and notifications up and running, my first bit of intelligence in the alerting process was disregarding events when the camera switched from visible light to infra-red mode. This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; switch occurs twice a day - visible to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; around dusk and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; to visible around dawn - and was a bit of an annoyance to me. When the switch-over happens, virtually all pixels in the image go white for a frame or two and the image switches between color and black and white. My gut reaction was to ignore events with a massive percentage of changed pixels around dawn or dusk, but that seemed too uncertain. With a bit of thought, I realized that detecting a change from color to black-and-white (or vice-versa) should be rather&amp;nbsp;straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the script was already written in Python, I installed &lt;a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/"&gt;pillow&lt;/a&gt;, a modern fork of the Python Imaging Library, and came up with the following snippet to tell whether a specific Frame from ZoneMinder is color or black-and-white (note this is a partial snippet with a lot of unrelated code&amp;nbsp;removed):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# lots of internals redacted here...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame_fmt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FrameId&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Finding if image is color or not for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;bands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;histogram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Loading image for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; from: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This loads the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; image (frame) from ZoneMinder as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt;, splits the image
into its color-component bands (red, green, and blue), and then checks if the histograms
of the three color bands are identical. If so, the image is&amp;nbsp;black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notification script simply looks at each event, checks if the first frame is color
and the last is black and white or vice-versa, and if so suppresses the notification
and renames the Event in ZoneMinder for later&amp;nbsp;cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is one issue with this method,&lt;/strong&gt; when ZoneMinder loses signal from a camera it
generates a completely blue frame until signal is regained. I&amp;#8217;ve only had this happen
once, but at some point I plan on modifying the above to ignore the blue &amp;#8220;loss of signal&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="monitoring"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#monitoring"&gt;Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided that I was sufficiently close to having a minimally-usable system that
I should turn my attention to monitoring it, and making sure I&amp;#8217;m alerted if it stops working.
Since I&amp;#8217;ve moved all of my personal services to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, I didn&amp;#8217;t have an existing monitoring
infrastructure for anything running in my home. Not wanting anything too heavy-weight or
complicated, and having an existing Lambda function to handle re-notification of CloudWatch
alarms, I hacked a &amp;#8220;monitoring system&amp;#8221; together using that Lambda function and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway
in a few&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality is relatively simple: every five minutes a Python script runs on my ZoneMinder
system that does a bunch of checks and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POSTS&lt;/span&gt; them to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; array of results. The
POSTed data for each check includes the timestamp, a check name, a boolean &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; field, and
an optional string with additional information. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway writes this information to DynamoDB,
and triggers a Lambda function if any of the &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; fields changed from true to false. The
Lambda is also run every 30 minutes, and notifies me via email or text message if any of the
check &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; fields is False &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; if any of the timestamp values are more than 10 minutes old.
For now, this should suffice as a really simple monitoring system. I also have a quick and simple
single-page web view of the current Dynamo&amp;nbsp;contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checks that I&amp;#8217;m currently running&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System load average&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk free space as reported by&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder daemon status as reported by&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder Run State (one of my custom values, not&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;stopped&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder status as reported by &lt;code&gt;zmpkg.pl&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#8220;running&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; - page loads and has a link to my primary&amp;nbsp;camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmdc process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmwatch process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My custom event server process running (based on zmeventnotification.pl; see&amp;nbsp;above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each&amp;nbsp;camera:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct image check against the Amcrest&amp;nbsp;camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera&amp;nbsp;enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image check via&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmu frame&amp;nbsp;rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmu last frame&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmc process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zma process running if Monitor is set to a motion-detecting&amp;nbsp;state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &amp;#8220;Image check&amp;#8221; tests, I do the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieve the binary image from the camera or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the python &lt;code&gt;imghdr.what()&lt;/code&gt; function to ensure it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the size of the image matches what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; thinks the monitor size&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;getextrema()&lt;/code&gt; function to ensure that there&amp;#8217;s more than one color in the image (i.e. fail if it&amp;#8217;s an all-blue &amp;#8220;signal lost&amp;#8221; or an all-black&amp;nbsp;image).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the histogram of the image has more than 20 distinct buckets / pixel&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve usually found Load Average to be an often misunderstood metric, and one that people rely on much too often (generally without knowing enough about it). ZoneMinder exposes it prominently in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; as one of the three health metrics, and while I&amp;#8217;m not sure I agree with this, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good metric for the specific workload of this particular system of mine. If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about Load Average as a performance metric on modern Linux systems, system performance expert and current Senior Performance Architect at Netflix Brendan Gregg has an excellent blog post, &lt;a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html"&gt;Linux Load Averages: Solving the Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="neural-network-object-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;Neural Network Object&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was researching how other ZoneMinder users are attempting to reduce false positives, I came by a &lt;a href="https://forums.zoneminder.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;amp;t=26222"&gt;post on the ZoneMinder Forums&lt;/a&gt; from someone who is using &lt;a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/"&gt;Joseph Redmon&amp;#8217;s Darknet yolo3&lt;/a&gt; neutral network object detection implementation for detecting and localizing meaningful changes in ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s captured frames. This idea immediately appealed to me; if I could reliably tell whether a frame contains a person, for my purposes as a security system, that would completely solve the environmental false positive problem. I was also very interested in Darknet yolo3 as it is simple to build and distributes pre-trained models - my initial testing was as simple as cloning a repo, downloading a few files, running &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, and then running the included command-line script on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; image. I was pretty amazed at how accurately it recognized the person, car, and dogs in the image I selected. There is also a Python wrapper around yolo3, &lt;a href="https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py"&gt;yolo34py&lt;/a&gt;, which I found quite easy to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using yolo34py I was able to relatively quickly add object detection to my Python-based ZoneMinder event notification script. Over three or four days of testing, I found yolo3 using the pre-trained model to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; accurate across all of the events my camera captured. The one down side was that, running on my Intel i7-2600 at 3.4GHz, it was taking a full &lt;em&gt;ten to fifteen seconds per frame&lt;/em&gt; to run the object detection. That&amp;#8217;s fine for testing, but if I were to rely on this as an alarm system, I&amp;#8217;d want something considerably&amp;nbsp;faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cursory glance at the Darknet documentation told me what I already knew - though I have no prior experience with the subject - that running neural network image processing with any reasonable speed requires a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. I decided that I could allocate around $100 to speeding up the detection given the Darknet documentation&amp;#8217;s claim of a 10x or better speedup on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. I found that about the best $100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; I could get on Amazon was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; Nvidia Quadro K600, so I purchased &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLTE8HK/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got the card and requisite software installed and recompiled Darknet with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt; support and attempted to run detection on an image, I was rather dismayed to be greeted with an error&amp;nbsp;message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt; Error: out of&amp;nbsp;memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;darknet: ./src/cuda.c:36: check_error: Assertion &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after just googling that error for Darknet, I found quite a few GitHub issues and mailing list threads explaining that Darknet Yolo3&amp;#8217;s default (and most accurate) model requires about 3.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;6GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; memory, far too much for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; card (at the moment, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; GPUs start at&amp;nbsp;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;500USD&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for the fate of my project, Darknet also has a pre-trained &amp;#8220;tiny&amp;#8221; model designed to work for low-memory GPUs - like the apparently-puny one I just bought. The project states that its accuracy is only about 2-3% lower, though the results I&amp;#8217;ve seen are noticeably inferior especially when two objects are in close proximity or overlap. For the time being, I&amp;#8217;m still getting notified by my Python script for every motion detection event, along with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOLO&lt;/span&gt; object detection results. I&amp;#8217;m saving every event that has questionable results for later comparison against the full (albeit slow, running on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;) model and possibly other object detection&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="homeassistant-and-z-wave"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#homeassistant-and-z-wave"&gt;HomeAssistant and&amp;nbsp;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I began experimenting with Darknet object detection, I decided that the number of false positive motion detection events I was receiving merited investigation into a more classic alarm system approach. I also received a coupon for the &lt;a href="https://simplisafe.com/"&gt;SimpliSafe&lt;/a&gt; home security system in my address change packet from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USPS&lt;/span&gt;. After a fair amount of investigation I decided that there weren&amp;#8217;t any off-the-shelf wireless home alarm systems that seemed attractive to me (I don&amp;#8217;t really need central monitoring, but I do need to be able to access the system and status programmatically) but this did get me doing some research, and I found there is a wide array of alarm system components using the &lt;a href="http://www.z-wave.com/"&gt;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt; radio technology that seemed suitable for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues speaks quite highly of &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt;, an open source (though Apache licensed) home automation suite written in Python3. Browsing through the project&amp;#8217;s website and documentation, I became reasonably confident that it could handle my needs for an alarm system (it has a fair amount of built-in logic for this use case, and other people actively use it for this) and that it also integrates natively with Z-Wave. Even better, it also has a native integration with ZoneMinder to tie the two systems&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liking HomeAssistant so far, but I&amp;#8217;ll leave the details of that for a future&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;Door/Window and Motion&amp;nbsp;Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research, I determined that I wanted Z-Wave Plus components for their better (than none) security and advanced features and purchased some initial Z-Wave components to test from Amazon: a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E/"&gt;Aeotec Gen5 Z-Stick&lt;/a&gt; Z-Wave controller for $45, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5HB4U5/"&gt;Ecolink Z-Wave Plus magnetic Door/Window sensor&lt;/a&gt; for $30, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQXXG0I/"&gt;Ecolink Z-Wave Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; Motion Sensor&lt;/a&gt; for $40. I figured that was a reasonable enough price to test the system and determine how well it works, and either move forward or return the&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#8217;ve had the Z-Wave components running via HomeAssistant for seven days, with the door sensor on my front door and the motion sensor placed atop the adjacent window. I&amp;#8217;ve configured HomeAssistant to do nothing more than notify me via Pushover when the door opens or motion is sensed. So far in a week, I&amp;#8217;ve received zero false-positive alarms and zero false-negative alarms, so I&amp;#8217;m quite happy. The motion or door opening signals make it from the sensors to HomeAssistant, out to Pushover, and to my phone within one to three seconds, which seems quite reasonable to me. The &amp;#8220;pet immunity&amp;#8221; on the motion sensor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still triggered by my two dogs walking around, but that&amp;#8217;s rather expected since they&amp;#8217;re fifty-five and seventy pounds, respectively, and not a problem since they&amp;#8217;re crated whenever I&amp;#8217;m not home. I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with the performance of both of these sensors so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="thermostat"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#thermostat"&gt;Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, after unpacking and enabling my two &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/pi2graphite"&gt;RaspberryPi-to-Graphite temperature sensors&lt;/a&gt;, I finally determined that I&amp;#8217;m not going crazy but the thermostat in my house was. It was wildly inaccurate, and letting the house overheat during the day and then over-cooling at night. I knew I had to replace it and, having seen that HomeAssistant supports climate control systems, immediately remembered my dream of having a computer-controlled thermostat that I briefly &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/RPyMostat"&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; since I first built a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxostat"&gt;crude solution&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/new-project/"&gt;in 2008&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short search on Amazon, I found the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095P7B80/"&gt;Iris &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;-101 Z-Wave thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a touchscreen 7-day programmable thermostat with Z-Wave, essentially the same unit as the &lt;a href="http://www.radiothermostat.com/products/"&gt;Radio Thermostat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;-101&lt;/a&gt; but intended to work with the Lowes Iris home automation system. A number of the positive reviews mentioned it working with HomeAssistant or other F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; home automation systems, and the $40 price was well below most networked thermostats and about the same as a normal &amp;#8220;dumb&amp;#8221; 7-day thermostat at local&amp;nbsp;stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with it. I had some initial concerns - even though the device is constantly powered and even a Z-Wave repeater, I had to configure HomeAssistant to explicitly poll it on a regular interval for up-to-date information - but now that I&amp;#8217;ve figured it out, the thermostat seems to be working quite well. I can view the current and target temperatures, the operational/power status of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HVAC&lt;/span&gt; system&amp;#8217;s fan and compressor, and set the target temperature and on/off controls. The unit &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; show up as two separate controls - heating and cooling - but that seems to be the standard for Z-Wave climate controls and logically matches up with the physical thermostat&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;heat/off/cool&amp;#8221; controls. I haven&amp;#8217;t done any automation with it yet, but at a minimum this should make it easy for me to control heating and cooling based on different temperature sensors throughout the house at different times of&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#whats-next"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Next&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I purchased two more outdoor Amcrest WiFi cameras - this time the &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt; 1080P models with an impressive 128º field of view - to complete my camera coverage, as well as a few more of the same &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5HB4U5/"&gt;Z-Wave door/window sensors&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of Z-Wave lightbulbs to try, and some well-reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AKSO80O/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZOOZ&lt;/span&gt; Z-Wave 4-in-1 sensors&lt;/a&gt; that combine motion sensors with light level, temperature, and humidity. Over the next week or two I&amp;#8217;ll be installing all of that to finally finish the system, and also spending quite a bit of time customizing HomeAssistant to be the heart of it all. I&amp;#8217;ll share my experiences in follow-up posts, but some of the things I have planned&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimenting with some other machine-learning-based object detection&amp;nbsp;implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Localizing detected objects to a ZoneMinder zone in the image, and using that to determine whether to alarm or&amp;nbsp;not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifying the ZoneMinder HomeAssistant integration to know about run&amp;nbsp;states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s alarm control panel component to implement real alarm system logic, with notifications to my&amp;nbsp;phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having my Amcrest ProHD pan/tilt camera, which has clear line of sight to both front and back doors, pan to a door and capture a snapshot when the door sensor&amp;nbsp;activates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work the other week, we decommissioned 24 old desktops - Dell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX280&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
that were used in the student labs as print release stations. They
didn&amp;#8217;t have anything sensitive on them, just Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;, but with
licensing and all we have to wipe Windows off of them before surplussing
them. Since there were 24 of them, it wasn&amp;#8217;t exactly going to be the
quickest task. Moreover, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX280&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s we used don&amp;#8217;t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; removable
media&amp;nbsp;drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.dban.org/"&gt;Darik&amp;#8217;s Boot And Nuke&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt;), which is a bootable Linux distro (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; or floppy) aimed at wiping
all of the fixed disks attached to a machine. While they do offer an
&amp;#8220;Enterprise&amp;#8221; version that supports network booting (and logging wipe
verifications to a central machine), the pricing isn&amp;#8217;t exactly favorable
for a small project (or something that just needs Windows to go away,
not a DoD-grade 7-pass overwrite with random data). Between the lack of
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; drive and the apparent need to select wiping options at boot, this
didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be the best method for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, with a little googling, I came by the
&lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/"&gt;Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; project, a ready-to-run
install server aimed at automating network-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; installation. It
turns out that Cobbler has a wiki article on &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/wiki/SystemRetirement"&gt;system
retirement&lt;/a&gt; that
deals with using Cobbler to automate a network boot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt;. Cobbler
takes control of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TFTP&lt;/span&gt;, boots the machine(s) to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot menu,
and allows selection of one of the cobbler&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;profiles&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general procedure is something along these&amp;nbsp;lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt; iso and grab the .ima image off of it. Loopback mount&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the &lt;code&gt;initrd&lt;/code&gt; and kernel into &lt;code&gt;/opt/cobbler/dban&lt;/code&gt; as
    &lt;code&gt;initrd.img&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vmlinuz&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you have cobblerd running (cobbler check), add a Distro for
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;code&gt;cobbler distro add --name=DBAN-1.0.7-i386 --kernel=/opt/cobbler/dban/vmlinuz --initrd=/opt/cobbler/dban/initrd.img --kopts="root=/dev/ram0 init=/rc nuke=dwipe floppy=0,16,cmos"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Profile for it:
    &lt;code&gt;cobbler profile add --name=DBAN-1.0.7-i386 --distro=DBAN-1.0.7-i386&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cobbler sync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming all went well, when we &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot a machine on the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; as
the Cobbler system, we&amp;#8217;ll get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot menu which will list
&lt;code&gt;DBAN-1.0.7.i386&lt;/code&gt; as one of the options. On some of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX280&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s that I
did, I had to go into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; and enable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot (or select &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; from
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; boot menu). Now, when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt; boots, we&amp;#8217;ll get the standard dmesg
output and then a selection screen allowing us to pick a wipe type (I
used the single pass all zeros for just getting rid of the old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;) and
select which disks to wipe. If you use the default wipe, just press
&amp;#8220;space&amp;#8221; to select all disks and then &amp;#8220;F10&amp;#8221; to begin the&amp;nbsp;wipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process allowed me to wipe 7 machines at once (8 port &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt;, 1 port
for the server). With a better &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; or (even better yet) a totally
automatic system as described below, it would essentially be limited to
whatever the server and network hardware will&amp;nbsp;handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a little more automation, we can run
&lt;code&gt;cobbler system add --name=default --profile=DBAN-1.0.7-i386&lt;/code&gt; which adds
a default profile to Cobbler, saying that any machines with MACs not
specifically assigned to a profile should boot the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt; profile, and
bypassing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot&amp;nbsp;menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WARNING&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; what follows will setup Cobbler and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt; to automatically
wipe all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt;-booting devices without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt; human intervention. Use at your
own risk and, for God&amp;#8217;s sake, don&amp;#8217;t plug your server into a production
network (I recommend this only in a lab environment with a dedicated
switch, all machines in one physical area, and no possibility of getting
on the same &amp;#8216;net as production&amp;nbsp;machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s theoretically possible to totally automate this setup. According to
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt; docs, it will also accept kernel options (kopts) that effect
how dnuke works - specifically, &lt;code&gt;--autonuke&lt;/code&gt; to tell it to wipe without
human intervention and a method option such as &lt;code&gt;--method=zero&lt;/code&gt; to select
the wipe method. This means that if we &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot with kernel options set
to &lt;code&gt;nuke="dwipe --autonuke --method=zero"&lt;/code&gt; we should go straight to the
dwipe utility (the heart of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBAN&lt;/span&gt;) and automatically wipe all disks by
writing zeros once - without operator intervention. Unfortunately,
there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/ticket/148"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in the
current (1.4.0) Cobbler which prevents quote-encapsulated strings in
kopts, meaning that we can&amp;#8217;t set one kernel option to a string with
whitespace as needed here. If this bug is fixed, it should allow this
process to work without any operator intervention, assuming the clients
will &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 2009-03-05&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;#8217;t tested it yet, but apparently the
Cobbler bug preventing complex kernel options has &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/cobbler/2009-February/002874.html"&gt;been
fixed&lt;/a&gt;.
The fix should be included in the 1.4.3 release and is currently in the
development&amp;nbsp;tree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="automation"></category><category term="cobbler"></category><category term="dban"></category><category term="pxe"></category><category term="retirement"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="wiping"></category></entry><entry><title>New Project</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/new-project/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-04T10:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-04T10:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-04:/2008/06/new-project/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, TuxTruck has been temporarily put on the back burner.

the hardware, and it looks like a minimum of $1000, more like $1000 if I
get what I had originally wanted. This is complicated by the fact that
my roommates and I were just hit with a $220 electric bill. Mostly,
that&amp;#8217;s due to the central air conditioning in our apartment, and the
horrible inefficiencies with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inefficient? Yes. At the moment, I&amp;#8217;m the only person in the apartment.
I&amp;#8217;m home for the weekend from 18:00 Friday through about 15:00 Monday. I
have class Monday-Thursday night 18:00-21:45. I work Tuesday-Friday
0900-1700. Even though the thermostat we have is &amp;#8220;programmable&amp;#8221;, it can
only be set for 4 time periods per day, weekdays and weekends. So, I
figured that a little added efficiency in calculating when the A/C
should run would go a long way towards energy&amp;nbsp;savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea - tuxOstat - is to have a Linux box that has temperature sensors
placed around the apartment, and a bank of relays to control the
heating/cooling systems. So, even though I only got the idea last
Thursday, version 1 should be up and running next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of&amp;nbsp;hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally I had planned on using a &lt;a href="http://www.soekris.com/net4526.htm"&gt;Soekris
    net4526&lt;/a&gt; that I had lying
    around. However, the added cost of a MiniPCI &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; card seemed
    prohibitive for a one-off project. Instead, I&amp;#8217;m using an old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;
    OmniBook laptop that was already lying behind my servers. It&amp;#8217;s
    running Debian&amp;nbsp;4.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve ordered (just 15 minutes ago) a &lt;a href="http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1014"&gt;Phidgets InterfaceKit
    0/0/4&lt;/a&gt;, which
    connects via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; and provides 4 relays. One will control the fan,
    one for the A/C compressor, one for the heat, and one unused (for&amp;nbsp;now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already had a
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;amp;products_id=1503"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DS9490&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    Dallas 1-wire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter from
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/"&gt;Hobby-Boards.com&lt;/a&gt; along with five
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=93"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DS18S20P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    1-wire parasite power temperature sensors. I&amp;#8217;ve wired those up with
    one in the living room near the existing thermostat, one in my
    bedroom, and one stuck about five feet up one of the A/C conduits,
    to sense when the system is actually putting out cold air. I&amp;#8217;ve had
    them logging to MySQL since 0200&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to bite the bullet and order a beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/635xes/index.html"&gt;CrystalFontz
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XES635BK&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMF&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    for the physical interface. It&amp;#8217;s a little backlit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; display, in a
    surface-mount box, along with four bi-color LEDs and a 6-button
    keypad. That should handle the interface for anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t want
    to grab a&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be looking for a eight-pin header so that the relays will plug
    right in to the screw-terminal block that the thermostat uses, to
    make for easy switching to the original thermostat if needed (or
    when moving out in a&amp;nbsp;year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in terms of&amp;nbsp;software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python text-based configuration/administration program. Will be
    accessed via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; for the actual&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of state data stored in files under&amp;nbsp;/var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A python script, run via cron every 2 minutes, that checks
    temperatures from the 1-wire bus, logs them to MySQL (on a remote
    host) and updates the temperature files in&amp;nbsp;/var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A master control script, run via cron every minute, that looks at
    the temperatures, the current system state, any manual overrides
    that exist, and decides what relays should be on or&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A daemon to handle relay&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A daemon to handle the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; display output and keypad input
    (including immediate manual&amp;nbsp;overrides).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method of providing overrides of the programmed schedule on a
    single-instance basis, i.e. &amp;#8220;system completely off from 2008-06-06
    18:00 to 2008-06-08&amp;nbsp;15:00&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
