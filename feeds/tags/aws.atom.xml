I&amp;#8217;m sharing it here because I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to find any clear guide to this exact process, and because I&amp;#8217;ve been really bad at keeping up with my blog&amp;nbsp;lately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work my team runs an internal instance of &lt;a href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/features/"&gt;Artifactory&lt;/a&gt;, a binary artifact repository manager that stores and serves artifacts for multiple software packaging systems (we use it for Ruby Gems, Maven packages, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPM&lt;/span&gt;, PyPI and Docker images). Many teams within our company rely on this service in their build and deploy processes. Last week we suffered a severe degradation of Ruby Gem serving from our Artifactory instance. One of the other engineers on my team was able to identify and resolve the problem based on intuition and experience, but I&amp;#8217;d like to walk through a process that I used to collect some detailed data for troubleshooting and confirmation of the&amp;nbsp;cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Artifactory service runs in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HA&lt;/span&gt; cluster of three &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances fronted by a classic Elastic Load Balancer (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;), with a private address only so that it&amp;#8217;s only available internally. Artifactory itself is a Java application running under Tomcat Catalina, with repository metadata stored in a MySQL &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; cluster and binary artifacts stored in S3. Artifacts are organized into repositories, with each repository containing a specific set of artifacts of a given type (i.e. Maven, gems, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPM&lt;/span&gt;, etc. In addition to storing and serving artifacts locally, Artifactory also has the capability to configure remote repositories that retrieve and cache artifacts from remote servers, and &amp;#8220;virtual&amp;#8221; repositories that combine two or more local or remote repositories into one unified&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was to begin with the high-level monitoring of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; provided by CloudWatch. While I&amp;#8217;d expected to see various metrics (most likely &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; 4xx or 5xx errors) far from their historical baseline, the only obvious deviations from normal were number of connections and backend request time (the time the actual Artifactory instances were taking to handle requests). While the rest of my team was also investigating, I attempted to start analyzing the Artifactory logs in our Splunk instance (our company&amp;#8217;s official Enterprise Log Solution). Unfortunately, I quickly found that the logs were not very useful. First, the logs contained a high volume of noise: repeated and persistent errors present for a very long time, overly verbose logs for certain actions, and Java stack traces split across dozens or hundreds of separate log entries in Splunk. Second, and more importantly, Artifactory was logging requests as coming from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address of the load balancer instead of the actual client and was missing other key pieces of information such as the user-agent and time taken to serve the request. It seemed clear to me that these logs weren&amp;#8217;t going to provide as much information as I&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I found that we had &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access logging&lt;/a&gt; enabled on the load balancer, sending access logs to S3 once an hour. Unfortunately, we weren&amp;#8217;t doing anything with those logs and I don&amp;#8217;t believe they had ever been referenced before; we certainly weren&amp;#8217;t ingesting them into Splunk or any other centralized log store. But the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html#access-log-entry-format"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access log format&lt;/a&gt; contains all of the information I was looking for: timestamp with milliseconds, exact request &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, actual client &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address, user-agent, sizes of request and response, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; and backend (Artifactory) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; status codes, and the time taken to process the request both by the backend and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the useful and relevant logs sitting in S3 and not being ingested to any analysis system, my first instinct was to use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/"&gt;Amazon Athena&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to execute &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;-like queries directly against data in S3. The results were certainly better than anything else we had access to, but without the ability to graph elements of interest over time they did not prove to be helpful in determining what patterns had changed since the previous hours, days and weeks. After some thought, my next instinct was to turn to the Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) stack that I&amp;#8217;m familiar with from previous&amp;nbsp;jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch"&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; is a clustered full-text search service built atop Apache Lucene, &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash"&gt;Logstash&lt;/a&gt; is a log aggregator and shipper with flexible plugin-based inputs, outputs, pre-processing and filters, and &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana"&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; a dynamic web interface for Elasticsearch geared towards search, analysis and graphing of time-series and log data. They&amp;#8217;re all open source projects now developed and commercially supported by &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/"&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt;, and together they form what is likely the largest and strongest open-source alternative to Splunk. Amazon has a managed &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/"&gt;Elasticsearch Service&lt;/a&gt; that includes the Kibana web interface, so I knew that getting up and running would be quick and&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to go from start to analyzing a months&amp;#8217; worth of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access logs in just over an hour, using the process described below (that time could&amp;#8217;ve been greatly reduced if I changed some default Logstash configuration and didn&amp;#8217;t read the logs from S3 one file at a time in serial). Fortunately one of the other engineers on my team was able to restore Artifactory service while I was going through this process, but I continued anyway in order to see what data we could obtain. &lt;em&gt;Note that none of this would have been needed if we were properly ingesting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access logs into a centralized analysis tool before the&amp;nbsp;incident.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify a suitable subnet in our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; that has a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; instance for outgoing Internet connectivity and a suitably high number of free &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses. Record the subnet&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Elasticsearch and Kibana run over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; on port 443, so identify or create appropriate security groups that allow you and your team to access port 443 (ideally, you access private resources in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; or Direct&amp;nbsp;Connect).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Elasticsearch Domain (cluster) in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;. Since I wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly familiar with the service, I did this manually through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console. For short-lived ad-hoc analysis, leave most options at their default and create a single-instance cluster. Use General Purpose &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; storage; I provisioned storage at just under 10x the size of the months&amp;#8217; raw logs in S3. I set the access policy for Elasticsearch to the canned option to disable requiring &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; signatures on requests and control access only via the security group, so that any engineers with access to the account could use the Kibana &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. I then added the subnet I identified in the first step and the security groups identified in the previous&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took about ten minutes for the Elasticsearch domain to become operational; until then, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console showed the domain to be in &amp;#8220;Processing&amp;#8221; status. During this time I spun up an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance to run Logstash on. I used the CentOS base &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt;, but Amazon Linux would work just as well. I created the instance in the same subnet as the Elasticsearch cluster, added a security group allowing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access for our team, and attached an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role allowing S3 access to retrieve the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance was running and accessible over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;, I installed Java 8 with &lt;code&gt;yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless&lt;/code&gt; and then followed the &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html#_yum"&gt;Logstash installation instructions for yum-based systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;/etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf&lt;/code&gt; as shown&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for the Elasticsearch domain to status to reach &amp;#8220;Active&amp;#8221;. Once that happens, you should see two URLs for the Domain: a &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; endpoint&amp;#8221; where the Elasticsearch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; can be reached (mine was &lt;code&gt;https://vpc-jantman-art-elb-test2-ryomklmh5hr7pcmhw7jvx7t374.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;) and a &amp;#8220;Kibana&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; where the Kibana web interface is available (mine was &lt;code&gt;https://vpc-jantman-art-elb-test2-ryomklmh5hr7pcmhw7jvx7t374.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_plugin/kibana/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance and confirm connectivity to Elasticsearch via &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, substituting in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; endpoint &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; for your cluster: &lt;code&gt;curl https://vpc-jantman-art-elb-test2-ryomklmh5hr7pcmhw7jvx7t374.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;. If all is well, you should get back a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; response that includes a name, cluster name, version, etc. If this doesn&amp;#8217;t work, troubleshoot connectivity issues until it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the Logstash service with &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start logstash&lt;/code&gt; and then watch the initial logs with &lt;code&gt;journalctl -u logstash&lt;/code&gt;. It should shortly tell you that it is writing logs to &lt;code&gt;/var/log/logstash&lt;/code&gt;. At this point you can &lt;code&gt;sudo tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log&lt;/code&gt; to follow logstash&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all went well, Logstash should tell you that it&amp;#8217;s connected to elasticsearch (&lt;code&gt;New Elasticsearch output&lt;/code&gt;) and S3 (&lt;code&gt;Registering s3 input&lt;/code&gt;), and then that it has successfully begun working (&lt;code&gt;Pipeline started succesfully&lt;/code&gt;). On new installations you should see a message similar to &lt;code&gt;[logstash.inputs.s3       ] Using default generated file for the sincedb&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that the S3 input is starting to process&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse to the Kibana &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; found in the Elasticsearch console, above (step 7). Soon after Logstash begins ingesting data, Kibana should recognize the new indices and prompt you to create an Index Pattern for them (if the interface says that no indices could be found, wait a minute or two and then refresh). Since Logstash creates a separate index for each days&amp;#8217; data named according to a &lt;code&gt;logstash-YYYY.MM.DD&lt;/code&gt; pattern, enter &lt;code&gt;logstash-*&lt;/code&gt; for your index pattern and click &amp;#8220;Next&amp;#8221;. The &amp;#8220;Time Filter field name&amp;#8221; used by our Logstash configuration file is &lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; (not &lt;code&gt;@timestamp&lt;/code&gt;), so select that from the dropdown and click &amp;#8220;Create Index Pattern&amp;#8221;. That&amp;#8217;s it, Kibana is&amp;nbsp;configured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &amp;#8220;Discover&amp;#8221; link on the left sidebar in the Kibana interface, and then click the clock icon in the far top right of the screen and select an appropriate time range for the data you&amp;#8217;re ingesting (I selected the last 30 days, as I was ingesting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access logs for the current month). After a brief delay messages should be visible and the graph of messages will populate. Because of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access logs are written to S3 and how Logstash ingests them, logs will be ingested in chronological order by day, so the graph by date is a good indication of ingest progress. &lt;img alt="screenshot of Kibana during initial data load" src="/GFX/kibana-initial-data.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When all data up to the current time is ingested you can either terminate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance running Logstash, or keep it running. It will check S3 for new files every minute and keep ingesting them as long as Logstash is running. &lt;em&gt;(Note: the Logstash configuration described here is only for ad-hoc analysis, not a long-running&amp;nbsp;need.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave further discussion of how data can be analyzed and visualized to others; the &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html"&gt;Kibana User Guide&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of it and even links to some introductory videos, and there is much information on the Internet. I find the recent versions of Kibana to be one of the best interfaces I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen for exploring complex log data, and it&amp;#8217;s also designed with graphical visualizations as a first-class citizen with many helpful&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For analysis of this particular issue I was focusing on &amp;#8220;backend_processing_time&amp;#8221;, the time it took Artifactory to handle requests. My first real dive into the data was graphing mean and 75th, 95th and 99th percentile processing times over all the&amp;nbsp;data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="graph of mean and percentile processing times" src="/GFX/artifactory_backend_time.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there&amp;#8217;s a large difference between the average and even 95th percentile versus the 99th throughout the data, the extreme jump in the 99th percentile value (about 16x the previous value and significantly more than the 95th) confirmed our findings that this was likely not a system-wide failure but something affecting a certain population of&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time we&amp;#8217;d resolved the issued by disabling a specific remote RubyGems repository (a largely forgotten and unsupported internal one used by a handful of teams) which was found to be offline. We presumed that having that remote repository included in virtual repositories, including our master &amp;#8220;all-gems&amp;#8221; repository, was causing them to fail as well. To evaluate this based on data, I graphed the processing times of requests to repositories that included the problematic one, and requests to repositories that did not. The result is the proverbial &amp;#8220;smoking gun&amp;#8221;. The top graph shows processing time of requests to repositories including the problematic one, which increase over twenty times the baseline and shows a shape very similar to our 99th percentile. The bottom graph shows processing time of requests to repositories that do not include the problematic one, and shows no discernible difference during the outage from the previous thirty&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="graph of processing times for the two groups of repositories" src="/GFX/gems-vs-not.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="logstash-configuration-file"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#logstash-configuration-file"&gt;Logstash Configuration&amp;nbsp;File&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logstash&amp;#8217;s configuration format has three main parts: input, filter, and output. Below you&amp;#8217;ll find the configuration file that I used for this project and an explanation of it. I can&amp;#8217;t take credit for most of it, but rather pieced it together under pressure from a few sources&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;input {

}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id="input"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#input"&gt;Input&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; section defines our data source, in this case the &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-s3.html"&gt;S3 input plugin&lt;/a&gt; which reads files from an S3 bucket (after reading the existing files, it polls every 60 seconds for new ones). The above example is configured to read from a bucket named &amp;#8220;our-artifactory-log-bucket-name&amp;#8221; in us-east-1, and read files under the &lt;code&gt;elb_access_logs/AWSLogs/423319072129/elasticloadbalancing/us-east-1/2018/03&lt;/code&gt; prefix. It also assigns a &amp;#8220;type&amp;#8221; of &lt;code&gt;elb&lt;/code&gt; to the logs, for reference later in the&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="filter"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#filter"&gt;Filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart and real power of Logstash is in its ability to transform data via both &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/transformation.html"&gt;built-in capabilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html"&gt;filter plugins&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in some other tools such as Splunk, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELK&lt;/span&gt; stack &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; data manipulation, parsing, extraction, and filtering is generally done where events originate in Logstash rather than on the server. Events are sent to Elasticsearch as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; documents, and Elasticsearch stores, indexes, searches, and returns those &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; documents exactly as they were sent&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filter we use here has a number of statements wrapped inside &lt;code&gt;if [type] == "elb"&lt;/code&gt;, which ensures that they only operate on logs from our S3 input which we assigned the &amp;#8220;elb&amp;#8221; type to. Let&amp;#8217;s examine the statements within the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; one by&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;grok {
    match =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTSPACE&lt;/span&gt;:loadbalancer} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;:client_ip}:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:client_port:int} (?:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;:backend_ip}:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:backend_port:int}|-) %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:request_processing_time:float} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:backend_processing_time:float} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:response_processing_time:float} (?:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:elb_status_code:int}|-) (?:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:backend_status_code:int}|-) %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:received_bytes:int} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:sent_bytes:int} \&amp;quot;(?:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORD&lt;/span&gt;:verb}|-) (?:%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GREEDYDATA&lt;/span&gt;:request}|-) (?:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NUMBER&lt;/span&gt;:httpversion}|-( )?)\&amp;quot; \&amp;quot;%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATA&lt;/span&gt;:userAgent}\&amp;quot;( %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTSPACE&lt;/span&gt;:ssl_cipher} %{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTSPACE&lt;/span&gt;:ssl_protocol})?&amp;quot;]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html"&gt;grok&lt;/a&gt; statements are one of Logstash&amp;#8217;s most commonly used filters. They parse arbitrary text and turn it into structured data via regular expression patterns. They also have many built-in shortcuts for &lt;a href="https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/blob/master/patterns/grok-patterns"&gt;common patterns&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;NUMBER&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NOTSPACE&lt;/code&gt;, etc). The above statement applies regular expression matching to the incoming log line (&lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt;) and assigns the results to named fields in the event (timestamp, loadbalancer, client_ip, client_port, etc.). This forms the basis for our structured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt; access log, and represents the bulk of the work that Logstash does when turning the lines of our text file access logs into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; documents suitable for&amp;nbsp;Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A Google search should turn up grok patterns for many common log types. If you need to develop your own, &lt;a href="https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt; is an invaluable tool for&amp;nbsp;experimentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;grok {
    match =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;request&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;%{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URIPROTO&lt;/span&gt;:http_protocol}&amp;quot;]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the previous grok statement we set the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; field, the full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; requested from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;GREEDYDATA&lt;/code&gt; pattern (&lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt;) based on its position in the log. Here, we extract the leading protocol from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; for Artifactory) and store it in a new &lt;code&gt;http_protocol&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;if [request] != &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; {
    grok {
        match =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;request&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;(?&amp;lt;request&amp;gt;[^?]*)&amp;quot;]
        overwrite =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;request&amp;quot;]
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; this trims the query string from request, if&amp;nbsp;present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;useragent {
    source =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;userAgent&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This runs the &lt;code&gt;userAgent&lt;/code&gt; field of the event through Logstash&amp;#8217;s built-in &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-useragent.html"&gt;useragent filter plugin&lt;/a&gt;. This parses the user-agent string using BrowserScope data and, for recognized user agents, turns it into structured data including information like browser family, operating system, version, and&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;date {
    match =&amp;gt; [&amp;quot;timestamp&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO8601&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This uses the &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-date.html"&gt;date filter&lt;/a&gt; to match an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO8601&lt;/span&gt;-format date&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; field (extracted in our first &lt;code&gt;grok&lt;/code&gt; pattern) and use it to set the event&amp;nbsp;timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="output"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#output"&gt;Output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a single output configured in the example above, the built-in &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html"&gt;elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; output plugin, that sends logs to our Elasticsearch instance. The only configuration it needs (following the instructions above) is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Elasticsearch domain, specified in the &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; field, and indication that the cluster uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;. It is important to note that the &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; include the &lt;code&gt;:443&lt;/code&gt; port specification explicitly, or else it will default to Elasticsearch&amp;#8217;s default port of 9200. Also note that if you configure Elasticsearch with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Authentication enabled, you must use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/awslabs/logstash-output-amazon_es"&gt;logstash-output-amazon_es&lt;/a&gt; plugin from Amazon&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="aws"></category><category term="amazon"></category><category term="elb"></category><category term="elasticsearch"></category><category term="logstash"></category><category term="kibana"></category><category term="logs"></category><category term="analysis"></category></entry><entry><title>Cloud Custodian Architecture, Deployment and Policy Preprocessing</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2017/10/cloud-custodian-architecture-deployment-and-policy-preprocessing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-24T16:49:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-24T16:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2017-10-24:/2017/10/cloud-custodian-architecture-deployment-and-policy-preprocessing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Details of how I setup Capital One&amp;#8217;s Cloud Custodain at work, including our monitoring, logging and policy&amp;nbsp;preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="toc"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published to my company&amp;#8217;s internal blog platform; I&amp;#8217;m publishing it here for the
larger Cloud Custodian user&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I&amp;#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time over the past few weeks working on our deployment of Capital One&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian"&gt;cloud custodian&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/c7n"&gt;c7n&lt;/a&gt;)
for rules and policy enforcement in our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; accounts, both to replace our aged
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Janitor-Home"&gt;Netflix Janitor Monkey&lt;/a&gt;
installation and to enable us to expand the cleanup rules we execute and begin
enforcing more granular policies. While we&amp;#8217;ve only been running c7n for a few months
(and most of that time in a test only/dry run mode), we&amp;#8217;ve already accumulated
29 different policies (mostly Janitor Monkey replacements for tag enforcement and low utilization instance termination)
and are adding new ones rather quickly. Based on interest from colleagues I&amp;#8217;d like
to explain a bit about how we manage and deploy Cloud Custodian, and specifically
about how we preprocess our policies to generate the &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overall-architecture"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#overall-architecture"&gt;Overall&amp;nbsp;Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We currently run all of our Cloud Custodian policies as Lambda functions, taking
advantage of c7n&amp;#8217;s excellent &lt;a href="http://www.capitalone.io/cloud-custodian/docs/policy/lambda.html"&gt;Lambda support&lt;/a&gt;.
Each policy currently runs on a schedule (based on CloudWatch Events); we&amp;#8217;ve experimented
with running policies based on Config rules, Instance state changes and CloudTrail Events,
but most of those executed too quickly to prove useful for our needs (specifically tag enforcement
policies, as many of our development teams use tooling that defers tagging until significantly
after resource creation). In addition to the main Lambda functions that execute the policies,
we run a number of other ancillary tools related to Cloud&amp;nbsp;Custodian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/tree/master/tools/c7n_mailer"&gt;Custodian Mailer (c7n-mailer)&lt;/a&gt;
  tool for email notifications, coupled with a customized
  &lt;a href="#redefaulthtmlj2-email-template"&gt;email template&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/blob/master/tools/c7n_mailer/msg-templates/default.html.j2"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;
  for visually appealing and useful notifications across email clients (like the example below). This also runs as a Lambda
  function, and processes notification events that c7n policies push onto an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue.
  &lt;img alt="screenshot of c7n notification email template" src="/GFX/custodian-email-example.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use Splunk as our (new) central logging solution and run a custom Lambda function, &lt;code&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda&lt;/code&gt;,
  forked from &lt;code&gt;c7n-mailer&lt;/code&gt; but modified to send cloud-custodian policy run results to Splunk Cloud instead of email.
  Cloud Custodian&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.capitalone.io/cloud-custodian/docs/generated/c7n.html#c7n.actions.Notify"&gt;notify action&lt;/a&gt;,
  which is used to trigger &lt;code&gt;c7n-mailer&lt;/code&gt;, works by pushing some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; data to an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue; this data includes the full
  details of the policy itself, the resources that the policy matched, and why (what filter(s)) each resource was matched.
  Our policy preprocessor (see below) adds a notify action to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; policy that sends to a specific, separate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue
  for the Splunk function. The Lambda function processes this queue every five minutes, removes some repetitive and
  less-important data (to get the message size below &lt;span class="caps"&gt;10KB&lt;/span&gt;), and then sends the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; message on to Splunk. This places
  the full data from every policy execution in Splunk, and allows us to search
  Splunk for high-level queries like &amp;#8220;every &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; Instance that c7n stopped&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;every resource matched by a specific policy&amp;#8221;,
  or &amp;#8220;every action that a specific policy has&amp;nbsp;taken&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous Lambda function executions - such as those triggered by CloudWatch Events - are automatically retried up
  to three times if the invocation fails. However, there&amp;#8217;s no easy way to tell if all tries of a particular function
  invocation failed. &lt;a href="#errorscanpy"&gt;errorscan.py&lt;/a&gt;
  is our solution to this problem. We configure all of our Cloud Custodian policy Lambda functions with a Dead Letter Queue,
  a feature of Lambda that pushes a message to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue if all retries of an invocation failed. &lt;code&gt;errorscan.py&lt;/code&gt; runs
  once a day via Jenkins and checks for messages in a single shared Dead Letter Queue (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLQ&lt;/span&gt;). If there are any, it uses CloudWatch
  Logs to associate the queue entry with the Lambda function that failed, and outputs the logs from the failed invocation(s).
  The &lt;code&gt;errorscan.py&lt;/code&gt; script also examines the Failed and Throttled Invocations metrics in CloudWatch for each function.
  If there were any entries in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLQ&lt;/span&gt; or failed/throttled invocations metrics beyond a specified threshold, the job will
  report that information and then fail, triggering a low urgency notification to our on-call&amp;nbsp;engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We store our policies in git, one file per policy, with common default values removed. Our &lt;a href="#policygenpy"&gt;policygen.py&lt;/a&gt; script,
  explained in detail below, reads the policy files, interpolates our defaults, performs some sanity checking,
  and then generates the single &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; file actually used by&amp;nbsp;c7n.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="test-and-deployment"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#test-and-deployment"&gt;Test and&amp;nbsp;Deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We test and deploy our Cloud Custodian infrastructure using a &lt;a href="#jenkinsfile"&gt;Jenkinsfile&lt;/a&gt;.
For simplicity of dependencies, most of the stages utilize the Jenkins &lt;a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow"&gt;Docker Workflow&lt;/a&gt;
plugin and run inside the public &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python/"&gt;python:2-wheezy&lt;/a&gt; image and the jobs that manage the
infrastructure dependencies run inside the public &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/terraform/"&gt;hashicorp/terraform&lt;/a&gt; image.
Most of the actual custodian commands are run from a &lt;a href="#makefile"&gt;Makefile&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it
easier to run the same commands from either the Jenkins pipeline or a local development&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We follow a pull request GitHub workflow, and only allow merges to the master branch from PRs that have been successfully
built by Jenkins. Our pipeline differentiates between builds of the master branch (which triggers deployment) and builds
of PRs or other branches (which are test/dry run&amp;nbsp;only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps in the pipeline are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraform&lt;/strong&gt; - run a &lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; for master, or a &lt;code&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt; for non-master. This uses terraform to manage the
  required infrastructure for c7n,
  namely the CloudWatch Log Group for the c7n lambda functions, the s3 bucket for the c7n output, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role that the
  c7n functions execute with, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queues for the mailer, splunk log shipper, and the dead letter&amp;nbsp;queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virtualenv&lt;/strong&gt; - Setup a new Python virtualenv in the Docker container for the following steps, and copy the current directory
  (git clone / Jenkins workspace) to &lt;code&gt;/app&lt;/code&gt; in the container. We do the latter because Jenkins runs as a normal user
  but the public Python docker container prefers to run as root (0:0). To prevent problems, we copy the Jenkins workspace
  to &lt;code&gt;/app&lt;/code&gt; in the container, run what we need to, and then copy any desired output back to the workspace and &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;
  it to Jenkins&amp;#8217; user and group when&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tox&lt;/strong&gt; - Install &lt;a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;tox&lt;/a&gt; in the virtualenv; we use this to run pytest unit tests for
  our custom code in subsequent&amp;nbsp;steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;policygen tests&lt;/strong&gt; - Run &lt;a href="#policygenpy"&gt;unit tests for our policygen.py&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda tests&lt;/strong&gt; - Run unit tests for our &lt;code&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda&lt;/code&gt; Splunk log shipper&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate&lt;/strong&gt; - Install dependencies for c7n, generate our &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; file using &lt;code&gt;policygen.py&lt;/code&gt;, and then
  run &lt;code&gt;custodian validate&lt;/code&gt; on the resulting file. This step also generates the &lt;code&gt;policies.rst&lt;/code&gt; file containing a
  table of our current policy names and comments/descriptions (which we include in our internal Sphinx-built documentation),
  and copies both &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;policies.rst&lt;/code&gt; back to the Jenkins workspace for archiving in the job&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mugc dry run&lt;/strong&gt; - Cloud Custodian deploys its Lambda functions via a reusable Lambda management library,
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/blob/master/c7n/mu.py"&gt;c7n.mu&lt;/a&gt;, and we use its garbage collection
  tool, &lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/blob/master/tools/ops/mugc.py"&gt;mugc.py&lt;/a&gt;, to clean up the
  Lambda functions and CloudWatch Events for policies we&amp;#8217;ve deleted. In this step, we do a dry run of the garbage
  collection&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;custodian dry run&lt;/strong&gt; - This performs a &lt;code&gt;custodian&lt;/code&gt; dry run as a final check for our policies, copies the
  dry-run results/output back to the Jenkins workspace, and archives it in the job&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run&lt;/strong&gt; - For builds of the master branch, we do the actual &lt;code&gt;mugc.py&lt;/code&gt; garbage collection of old Lambdas/Events,
  do the actual &lt;code&gt;custodian&lt;/code&gt; run to provision our c7n Lambda functions, and provision the &lt;code&gt;c7n_mailer&lt;/code&gt; Lambda function.
  For non-master branches, we only install the mailer&amp;#8217;s dependencies (sanity check) and print our mailer config file
  to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda&lt;/strong&gt; - For builds of master, we install our &lt;code&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda&lt;/code&gt; code and provision its
  Lambda function. For builds other than master, we run &lt;code&gt;sqs_splunk_lambda --validate&lt;/code&gt; to validate its configuration
  file. This step is run in a &lt;code&gt;VaultBuildWrapper&lt;/code&gt;, as it securely retrieves Splunk credentials from our
  &lt;a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/"&gt;HashiCorp Vault&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Docs&lt;/strong&gt; - We run a Sphinx build of our documentation, which is mostly static content but also includes the
  generated list of our policies from step&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish Docs&lt;/strong&gt; - For builds of master, we push the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; documentation built in the last step to the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch
  for serving via GitHub&amp;nbsp;Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for Monitoring Job&lt;/strong&gt; - For builds of master, we run
  &lt;a href="https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/"&gt;Job &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create or update a persistent Jenkins job
  (outside the pipeline) that runs &lt;code&gt;errorscan.py&lt;/code&gt; once a day and notifies us if any Lambda function errors were&amp;nbsp;found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have shell scripts provided for testing changes and doing dry runs locally, which use the same Docker images and Makefile as the Jenkins-based&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="policy-preprocessing"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#policy-preprocessing"&gt;Policy&amp;nbsp;Preprocessing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="#policygenpy"&gt;policygen.py&lt;/a&gt; script is responsible for reading in the directory of per-policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; files,
performing some sanity checks on them, interpolating defaults from a &lt;a href="#defaultsyml"&gt;policies/defaults.yml&lt;/a&gt; file,
and then writing out the single &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; that Cloud Custodian actually runs. The overall program flow is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read in all &lt;code&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; files from the &lt;code&gt;policies/&lt;/code&gt; directory; build a dict of policy names to the policy contents, deserialized from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; into native Python data structures. For each policy file, ensure that the filename without the extension (i.e. the basename) matches the value of the &amp;#8220;name&amp;#8221; key in the policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;; raise an exception if any policies do not have a filename that matches their policy&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the &lt;code&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; policy from that dict, and store it separately for later&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over all policies in the dict, lexicographically by policy name; for each of them, interpolate our defaults into the policy and append the result to a &amp;#8220;policies&amp;#8221; list. See below for details of the defaults interpolation&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate &amp;#8220;cleanup&amp;#8221; policies and append them to the list. This step is a holdover from before cloud-custodian had the &lt;a href="https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/blob/master/tools/ops/mugc.py"&gt;mugc Lambda cleanup tool&lt;/a&gt; but we still use it; this uses the names of all current policies to generate two policies that identify Lambda functions and CloudWatch Event Targets, respectively, that were provisioned by Cloud Custodian for policies that no longer exist. The resulting policies run once per day, and email us if there are any &amp;#8220;orphaned&amp;#8221; Cloud Custodian functions or&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a series of sanity and safety checks on the generated policies (see &amp;#8220;Policy Sanity Checks&amp;#8221;, below, for more&amp;nbsp;information).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the final &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; that will be used by Cloud Custodian, containing all of our final&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a &lt;code&gt;policies.rst&lt;/code&gt; file that will be incorporated into our Sphinx-generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; documentation site. This file contains a table with one row per policy for all of our policies; the first column is the policy name as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; link to the policy &lt;code&gt;.yml&lt;/code&gt; file in the git repository, and the second column is the text of the policy&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;comment&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;comments&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="interpolating-defaults-into-policies"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#interpolating-defaults-into-policies"&gt;Interpolating Defaults into&amp;nbsp;Policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of &lt;code&gt;policygen.py&lt;/code&gt; is the interpolation of defaults into policies.
When we originally deployed Cloud Custodian in our test environment, we noticed that our
policies had two large blocks that were almost identical across all policies: the &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;
configuration telling Cloud Custodian to deploy the policies as Lambda functions triggered
by periodic CloudWatch Events rules, and the notification action that we use for email
notifications. This was the genesis of &lt;code&gt;policygen.py&lt;/code&gt;; we moved these common policy
sections to a &lt;code&gt;defaults.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, and wrote &lt;code&gt;policygen.py&lt;/code&gt; to perform intelligent
merging of the defaults with each policy file, allowing us to override defaults in the
individual policies but still keep some mandatory&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="defaultsyml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Our &lt;code&gt;defaults.yml&lt;/code&gt; file currently looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: **&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;** policies will have an additional notification action for the Splunk &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;periodic&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This will trigger our rules at 15:20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; (11:20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt; / 10:20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EST&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# it might be better to spread them out over time a bit, but right now our&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# main concern is ensuring that policies run during work hours.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This provides us with our default execution mode (Lambda function triggered once a day
at a defined time via CloudWatch Events) and its configuration options (mainly, the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role used for execution, the Dead Letter Queue, CloudWatch Log Group, and S3 output
configuration for policy results), as well as our default email notification configuration
using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; to&amp;nbsp;c7n-mailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these options can be overridden in individual policies intelligently; a simple example
policy that emails us about any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; Peering Connections in a state other than
&amp;#8220;active&amp;#8221; would look&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REMINDER&lt;/span&gt;: defaults.yml will be merged in to this. See the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;README&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;peering-connection&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;us@example.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This policy automatically inherits all of the &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; defaults configuration and the &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt;
action is merged with the defaults; the resulting generated policy will combine all of the keys
in the defaults notification action and the policy notification action, with the exception of the
&lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; block where the defaults are overridden by the&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual process of merging the policy and defaults is a recursive deep merge of the dicts, merging
the individual policy over a copy of the defaults, with special logic for lists and
&lt;code&gt;type: notify&lt;/code&gt; actions. Overall, the procedure&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We start with &lt;a href="#defaultsyml"&gt;policies/defaults.yml&lt;/a&gt; as a base, and layer the policy-specific config on top of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We merge recursively (i.e. deep&amp;nbsp;merging).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keys from the policy overwrite identical keys in the defaults; the policy-specific config always wins over the&amp;nbsp;defaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of lists (i.e. the &lt;code&gt;actions&lt;/code&gt; list), the end result includes all elements that are simple data types (i.e. strings). For
  dict items in lists, we look at the value of the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; element; if both the policy and the defaults lists have
  dicts with the same &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, we merge them together, with the policy overwriting the defaults. Defaults dicts without a
  matching &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; in the policy will always be in the final result, &lt;strong&gt;except for&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;actions&lt;/code&gt; with a type of &lt;code&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt;; policies that do
  not have a &lt;code&gt;type: notify&lt;/code&gt; action will not have one added. This allows us to set defaults for dicts embedded in lists, like the
  &lt;code&gt;type: notify&lt;/code&gt; action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When finished merging, add a notification action to every policy that pushes to the Splunk queue, which is handled by our
  sqs_splunk_lambda&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To merge the two dicts together, we begin with a copy of the defaults and then iterate over all of the items in the policy as key/value pairs, updating the defaults as we go to build the final&amp;nbsp;policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the key from the policy-specific config isn&amp;#8217;t in the defaults, we add the key and value and move on.&amp;nbsp;Otherwise;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the value is a list, we use special list merging logic (see below) and update with the result of the list&amp;nbsp;merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the value is another dict, we call the same function recursively and update with its&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the value isn&amp;#8217;t a list or dict, we assume it to be a simple type (string, int, etc.) and overwrite the default value with the one specified in the policy-specific&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end result of this is&amp;nbsp;returned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List merging is somewhat special, to let us set defaults for&amp;nbsp;actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We begin with the policy itself as the base list, instead of the&amp;nbsp;defaults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any non-dict items in defaults that aren&amp;#8217;t in the policy are appended to the policy&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any dict items in the policy list with a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; key/value pair that matches one of the dict items in the defaults list, will have additional key/value pairs added from the defaults&amp;nbsp;dict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any defaults dicts not handled under the previous condition will be appended to the result, with the exception of a &lt;code&gt;type: notify&lt;/code&gt; dict in the &lt;code&gt;['actions']&lt;/code&gt; path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="policy-sanity-checks"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#policy-sanity-checks"&gt;Policy Sanity&amp;nbsp;Checks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before writing out the final &lt;code&gt;custodian.yml&lt;/code&gt; configuration, each policy is run through a sanity/safety checking
function. The function is written to be easily extendable to add new policy checks (written in Python), but currently
only has two&amp;nbsp;checks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that any &lt;code&gt;marked-for-op&lt;/code&gt; filters come first in the filter list. When we originally
deployed Cloud Custodian, one of our policies had a &lt;code&gt;marked-for-op&lt;/code&gt; filter (which allows Cloud Custodian to take action
on a resource that was specifically tagged for delayed action in the future) accidentally nested under an &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; clause
in the policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; (which was unfortunately easy to do, as it only required accidentally indenting the block two extra
spaces). This resulted in the policy taking action immediately instead of a week later, which could have been catastrophic
(luckily the action in this case was benign). To prevent this from happening again, our checks ensure that &lt;code&gt;marked-for-op&lt;/code&gt;
filters, if present, always come at the beginning of the list of&amp;nbsp;filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that any policies with &lt;code&gt;mark-for-op&lt;/code&gt; actions also filter out resources that already have the cooresponding tag,
to prevent policies from constantly marking for a future date and never taking&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re still in the process of expanding our Cloud Custodian deployment; right now we&amp;#8217;re only running
it in one region of one non-production account, but that one region contains the vast majority of our infrastructure.
We&amp;#8217;ll be expanding to other regions and then production accounts in the next few weeks, and that will require changing
some portions of our configuration, management, and policy generation code to compensate. So far we&amp;#8217;ve seen good results
with using Cloud Custodian to enforce tagging and cost-reduction rules, such as terminating instances that have been
idle for a long time. We hope to continue extending the role that Cloud Custodian plays in cost reduction, and also
expand into enforcing more security and &amp;#8220;housekeeping&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repository that we use for this is private, but I&amp;#8217;ve been given permission to publish some of the generic portions
of the related code. I don&amp;#8217;t really have an established method of publishing source code that I don&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;own&amp;#8221; and
am not the authoritative source for, so I&amp;#8217;m just going to leave it inline&amp;nbsp;here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        When c7n is run, it provisions all policies as lambda functions. But if&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        policies are removed, it doesn&amp;#39;t know how to clean them up. See&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        https://github.com/capitalone/cloud-custodian/issues/48&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        As a workaround for this, we tag all Lambda funcs created by c7n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        with Project: cloud-custodian and a Component tag of the policy name.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        This method generates policies that look for cloud-custodian Lambda&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        functions and CloudWatch Events that aren&amp;#39;t in the current list of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        policies, and therefore probably need cleanup, and notifies us.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        :param policies: list of policy dictionaries&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        :type policies: list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        :return: list of c7n cleanup policies to add&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        :rtype: list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# base policies that just need filters added&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;lcleanup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;c7n-cleanup-lambda&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;comment&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Find and alert on orphaned c7n Lambda functions&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

but my personal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; account (mostly a single tiny t2.micro instance that handles a tiny amount
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; traffic and some cron jobs) has languished. Recently I&amp;#8217;ve undertaken a project to modernize
it, moving from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance using an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt; baked by &lt;a href="https://www.packer.io/"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and some
custom Ruby code to manage it, to a barebones instance acting as an
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/"&gt;Elastic Container Service (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; Docker host, and all of my applications
running in containers. This makes for much easier testing and deployment, and is a lot lower effort than
baking and testing a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt; every time I want to change an nginx config file (yes, everything is&amp;nbsp;immutable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got most of the basic work done and every resource in the account imported into
&lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;terraform&lt;/a&gt;, containers created and tested to replace what my old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;
instance is doing, and terraform management of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECS&lt;/span&gt; tasks and services too. So, I decided that
I&amp;#8217;d better setup some monitoring of all this before I forget about it. I try my best to keep my account
in the free tier for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;; my bills have usually been about $15 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;/month in the past (mostly the t2.micro
instance and Route53) and I&amp;#8217;m expecting to go up to about $20/month with the new&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten some basic monitoring in place - 7 CloudWatch Alarms for the important things, and a
Lambda function running every 30 minutes that does some more complicated and non-metric checks (and
sends to the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; topic as the alarms if it finds a problem). However, I realized how spoiled
I&amp;#8217;ve been at my day job, where a lot of our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; monitoring infrastructure relies on
&lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/"&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt; (both
of which I love not only for their functionality but also for their APIs). While the new
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards-create-use-customized-metrics-views/"&gt;CloudWatch Dashboards&lt;/a&gt;
feature is pretty cool for a tiny infrastructure with no other monitoring tools
(and they can finally be managed via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;), CloudWatch still had two big pain points for me
(aside from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/"&gt;cost past the free tier&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no option for re-notification from Alarms; if you set an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; Topic target for a
  CloudWatch Metric Alarm, the notification is sent &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; when the Alarm changes state.
  And that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notification messages are horribly&amp;nbsp;plain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the first problem, I just have my custom monitoring Lambda function also check
for any CloudWatch Alarms in a non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; state for longer than 30 minutes (how often the
function runs) and re-notify for them. The second solution is a bit more&amp;nbsp;involved&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-problem"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lambda function that I put in place to do some monitoring sends alerts to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; Topic
that delivers them to my phone via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and to my personal email account. While I&amp;#8217;ve made use
of the ability to &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/PublishTopic.html#sns-message-formatting-by-protocol"&gt;send different messages per protocol&lt;/a&gt;
to send a short notification to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and a longer email, I still really miss the rich context
of notifications from real monitoring systems that include graph images and other useful
information. This becomes an even bigger inconvenience since I&amp;#8217;m rarely logged in to the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console for my personal account, and doing so involves a dance with several long passwords
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MFA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wanted a way to be able to receive an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; monitoring notification and actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;
the metric graphs or events that generated it, rather than getting a plaintext (yeah, the
Simple &lt;em&gt;Notification&lt;/em&gt; Service is clearly designed for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and mobile push, and can&amp;#8217;t even
send &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; email) description of the triggered alarm. My first thought had been a Lambda
function triggered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; topic, that would identify the alarm(s) in question, render
a graph of them, and then send that in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; email via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SES&lt;/span&gt;. But that seemed like much more
work than I was interested in; all I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed to make this workable was a way to quickly
view alarms, metrics and events in&amp;nbsp;CloudWatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This is a bit of a kludge. It was designed for a tiny personal account with one human user, no monitoring other than CloudWatch, and for minimal&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For integration with non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAML&lt;/span&gt; identity providers (&amp;#8220;custom federation brokers&amp;#8221;), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt;
provides a way to
&lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html"&gt;create a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; that enables federated users to access the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console&lt;/a&gt;.
In short, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; user with the required permissions can call &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html"&gt;AssumeRole&lt;/a&gt;
to generate temporary credentials for a specified &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role, and then pass those credentials in
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation&lt;/code&gt; and get back a temporary &lt;code&gt;SigninToken&lt;/code&gt; granting
access to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console with the assumed role. This token can be used to construct a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; that signs in
to the Console under the assumed role and brings the user to a specified destination &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one catch to this process (documented on the link above) is the user that makes the &lt;code&gt;AssumeRole&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; call must have
long-term credentials (i.e. a real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; User). The call to the &lt;code&gt;/federation&lt;/code&gt; endpoint will fail if &lt;code&gt;AssumeRole&lt;/code&gt; was called
by another assumed role&amp;#8217;s temporary credentials, such as a Lambda function or Instance Profile. That tripped me up at first,
but I ended up figuring out a workable&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role for read-only cloudwatch access and attach the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;-managed CloudWatch Read Only
  policy to it (&lt;code&gt;arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess&lt;/code&gt;). This is the role that our pre-authorized
  (federated) console login will&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; User that we&amp;#8217;ll use to make the AssumeRole call from our Lambda function. This user should have
  a policy with only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; permission: calling &lt;code&gt;sts:AssumeRole&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; Role we created in the previous&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy our Lambda function, and pass the Access Key &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and Secret Access Key to it as environment variables.
  This is terrifyingly insecure (see note below), but little risk read-only credentials and an account that
  only has one other&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add code to our Lambda function to call AssumeRole for the cloudwatch read-only role, and then create the
  &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html"&gt;federated login &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  for the Console. For this part, I found a really helpful
  &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/weavenet/d21b288327bcc4947e690be13e19c79c"&gt;gist with the Python/boto3 implementation already done&lt;/a&gt;.
  For the &lt;code&gt;Destination&lt;/code&gt; parameter on the signin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, I specified the full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to the relevant
  CloudWatch Dashboard with my&amp;nbsp;metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embed this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; notification text. Most email clients should auto-link the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, so you&amp;#8217;ll end up with an email
  notification that&amp;#8217;s still plaintext, but includes a clickable link for a read-only CloudWatch view with no
  additional authentication required. This provides a much quicker &amp;#8220;ok, what does this problem look like?&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longer note on security:&lt;/em&gt; This isn&amp;#8217;t terribly secure. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t implement anything like this at my day job.
But I&amp;#8217;m the only user that has access to both my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; account and my email. If someone gets access to my email,
the fact that they can also view my CloudWatch metrics is likely the least of my worries. Similarly, putting
actual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; User credentials in Lambda environment variables is horribly, painfully, terrifyingly insecure. But
the credentials are read-only and only for CloudWatch, and in order to them, someone would need to have access
to one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Users in the account, all of which are much more privileged. So, I decided that it&amp;#8217;s an acceptably
small risk. I also wouldn&amp;#8217;t be handing out pre-signed URLs, even with a very limited read-only role, in a
multi-user context. But once again, for a single-user low-value account, it&amp;#8217;s a workable&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short note on cost:&lt;/em&gt; If I were setting up even a similarly minuscule infrastructure for any organization that
relied on it, I&amp;#8217;d certainly invest in real monitoring solutions. &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/"&gt;Datadog&amp;#8217;s pricing&lt;/a&gt;
isn&amp;#8217;t bad at all, with a $15 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; per month per host plan (their free plan has 1-day data retention, so it&amp;#8217;s
really just a demo) and &lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/pricing/"&gt;PagerDuty starts at&lt;/a&gt; $9 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;/user/month. But the
combination of those two is more than my entire monthly infrastructure bill right now, so&amp;#8230; not really worth it for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#next-steps"&gt;Next&amp;nbsp;Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get around to it, I&amp;#8217;d like to stop sending email and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; notifications directly from CloudWatch alarms,
and instead pass them through a Lambda function first. This would provide a means to include the pre-authorized
Dashboard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; described above, as well as some additional context (such as the last N metrics for the alarm
and the alarm&amp;nbsp;history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, though this is quite a bit more work, I&amp;#8217;d figure out a simple way of rendering a graph of the
CloudWatch metric in question, and move email notifications from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SES&lt;/span&gt;, sending &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; emails with
a bit more detail and some useful graphs. Another option would be to continue with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt;, but (assuming I
consider my email to be relatively secure and my notifications to be not-too-sensitive, both of which are
true) generate graphs and decently-useful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; pages for each alert, upload them (at pseudo-random paths,
for some level of security from casual onlookers) to a public S3 bucket with website access enabled,
and include &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;notification.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="aws"></category><category term="iam"></category><category term="monitoring"></category><category term="notifications"></category></entry><entry><title>Tooling for AWS - webhooks to SQS via API Gateway and Lambda</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2016/08/tooling-for-aws-webhooks-to-sqs-via-api-gateway-and-lambda/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-06T21:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-06T21:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2016-08-06:/2016/08/tooling-for-aws-webhooks-to-sqs-via-api-gateway-and-lambda/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Project I created that uses Python and Terraform to setup an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway instance to receive webhooks, and enqueue their content in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queues via&amp;nbsp;Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago at work, I was party to two discussions about possible tooling needs, both very low-priority. One was the possible need to sync MarkDown documentation
from GitHub repositories to&amp;#8230; another thing that can hold docs. The other was relating to the new Version 2 Docker Registry, &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/distribution"&gt;distribution&lt;/a&gt;.
We have some Jenkins jobs that dynamically populate dropdown fields for build parameters with Docker image names and tags, using the &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Choices+Plugin"&gt;Active Choices Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.
Right now we&amp;#8217;re directly querying the Docker Registry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; from Groovy, every time the Build With Parameters page is loaded. With the original version 1 Docker Registry,
images were often missing from the results (eek!) but the performance was good. With the switch to the v2 Registry, it takes almost two minutes to load the page.
While brainstorming solutions, we decided that caching the list of images and tags in the Registry was the solution. For bonus points, it would also be nice to
be able to query based on image labels - something that&amp;#8217;s not exposed in the Registry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; at all. Luckily, the Registry has an option to fire a webhook every time
a new image is&amp;nbsp;pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems have solutions that involve webhooks, from GitHub and Docker Distribution, respectively. They also both involve doing time-consuming things in custom code with the
data in those hooks - transforming MarkDown to another markup and pushing the result to an on-premesis system in the case of GitHub, and &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt;ing and inspecting Docker
images in the case of the Registry. As such, the &amp;#8220;typical&amp;#8221; webhook things like &lt;a href="https://zapier.com/"&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#8217;t fit the bill. All I really needed was something to receive webhooks
and push the content of them into a queue. Ideally, it would also be something that would utilize existing services we have, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working a bunch of nights and the good part of a weekend, I have a solution: my new &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/webhook2lambda2sqs"&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs&lt;/a&gt; Python&amp;nbsp;package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implements what I think is the cheapest and lowest-overhead solution for anyone with an existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway&lt;/a&gt; that receives json &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It passes them to a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda Function&lt;/a&gt; which pushes the content to one or more &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; queues, for consumption by an&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling is written in Python, but leverages &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;HashiCorp&amp;#8217;s Terraform&lt;/a&gt; to actually manage the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; configuration file as simple&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;{
  &amp;quot;endpoints&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;some_resource_name&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;queues&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;myqueue&amp;quot;]
    },
  },
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and a single command (&lt;code&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs genapply&lt;/code&gt;), you&amp;#8217;ll have the complete system up and running, receiving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; requests
at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;-generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and pushing them into the &lt;code&gt;myqueue&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue. Best of all, going by my testing (this is based on the time
the Lambda function takes to run, which can vary quite a bit), the whole thing is &lt;strong&gt;free for the first 1 million requests per month&lt;/strong&gt;
if your account is still on the Free Tier, and otherwise is less than $4/month for the first million&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration can handle setting up multiple distinct endpoint paths in the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway, each
sending the data to one or more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queues. It also has options for enabling logging (to CloudWatch Logs) both in the function
and on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway, pushing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway metrics to CloudWatch, and configuring rate&amp;nbsp;limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs&lt;/code&gt; program generates the Python code for the lambda function and packages it correctly for Lambda, and
then generates a Terraform configuration to manage all required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; resources. Separate commands are available that wrap Terraform
(mainly to deal with some issues with its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway implementation) to run &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt;. There are
also helper commands to view the Lambda Function and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway logs from CloudWatch, view messages in the queue(s) and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; a test message to one or all of the&amp;nbsp;endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full documentation is available at &lt;a href="http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;http://webhook2lambda2sqs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&lt;/a&gt;

It certainly has some big things going for it; it supports a whole bunch of providers (including on-prem, non-cloud stuff like VMWare and Docker) as well as some database engines and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; providers and can even manage GitHub teams, it can plan changes before committing them (which CloudFormation only &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-change-sets-for-aws-cloudformation/"&gt;very recently&lt;/a&gt; learned), and it can store the current state of your infrastructure in &lt;a href="https://www.consul.io/"&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt;. Also a big step past CloudFormation, it has &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html"&gt;provisioners&lt;/a&gt; including local execution, remote execution, file copying and Chef (strangely no built-in support for Puppet, but the remote-exec can do that) that can reach out to your newly-created instances and take actions on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform also has a &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/template/index.html"&gt;template provider&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s used any time you need a templated file, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance user-data or dynamically generated scripts to place on hosts. Terraform uses a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt; for its &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html"&gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt;, either the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;-like but slightly-more-human-readable &lt;a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl"&gt;Hashicorp Configuration Language (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCL&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; or the same information conveyed in pure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;. The configuration language supports variables (passed in at the command line or in a file) and is based on &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html"&gt;string interpolation&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of functions defined. It&amp;#8217;s also worth noting that Terraform is written in Go; it has a &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/index.html"&gt;plugin system&lt;/a&gt; but only for Providers and Provisioners; there&amp;#8217;s no way to add core functionality (I suppose I&amp;#8217;ve been spolied by Puppet having such good support for adding core functionality via Ruby, or HashiCorp&amp;#8217;s Vagrant having a config file that itself is&amp;nbsp;Ruby).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#8217;ve been nice and said some great things about Terraform (and it really is; at least for the way my current job is managing infrastructure, I&amp;#8217;ve fallen in love with it, and it certainly does fix some shortcomings that I found in CloudFormation, specifically with pre-execution plans and ability to interact with resources), on to my complaints of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="local-state-storage"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#local-state-storage"&gt;Local State&amp;nbsp;Storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first complaint is that by default, Terraform stores the state of your infrastrucutre in a file in your current working directory. It uses this to attempt to figure out the already-existing resources you&amp;#8217;ve created, and only make the required changes. The first time I used terraform, I completely destroyed one of our (luckily non-production) services; coworkers of mine have brought down production services because of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say that we have a Terraform configuration which takes one variable, &lt;code&gt;environment&lt;/code&gt;. That variable determines the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; and subnets we deploy into, our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; names, and also gets passed to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances via user-data. We build our infrastructure with &lt;code&gt;environment = "prod"&lt;/code&gt;, and everything works right - we now have a production cluster of our service. Then we want to test some changes, so we run again with &lt;code&gt;environment = "dev"&lt;/code&gt;. The naive - and logical - assumption would be that we get a second &amp;#8220;dev&amp;#8221; cluster of our service. Nope. Terraform finds the &lt;code&gt;terraform.tfstate&lt;/code&gt; file in our current directory, reads it, and takes it to be the current state of our infrastructure. It sees that we &lt;strong&gt;changed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;environment&lt;/code&gt; from &amp;#8220;prod&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;dev&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; so it destroys our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record, and creates new ones for &amp;#8220;dev&amp;#8221; (applying the requested&amp;nbsp;changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This teaches us two important&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt; run &lt;code&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt;. Even if you think your changes are trivial, examine what Terraform will do before running &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt; run &lt;code&gt;terraform&lt;/code&gt; through a wrapper. We have a simple Rake task in an internal rubygem that ensures that Terraform will always store state in Consul, so it won&amp;#8217;t be locked to one person&amp;#8217;s local machine, and also removes any local state files before running so they won&amp;#8217;t pollute the run or result in changes intended for one isolated instance of our Terraform configuration from being applied to&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="functions"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#functions"&gt;Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html"&gt;configuration interpolation&lt;/a&gt; has a bunch of built-in functions for working with variables. They&amp;#8217;re a subset of what you&amp;#8217;d expect in a language that is mainly based around strings, arrays and maps/hashes: split, join, concat, lookup (get a hash item by key), index (find the index of an item in a list), element (return the n&amp;#8217;th element of a list), format (sprintf-like), etc. However, there&amp;#8217;s no function to retrieve only unique elements from a list. This becomes a problem especially when dealing with multi-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt;/multi-subnet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; resources, as some of them (e.g. managing a set number individual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances outside of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASG&lt;/span&gt;, such as when assigning static IPs) require a list of subnets matching the number of resources, and others (cross-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt; ELBs) require a list of unique&amp;nbsp;subnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform and its language have no way to add this functionality (&lt;em&gt;see note below&lt;/em&gt;); the only option that I&amp;#8217;ve found is to wrap Terraform in some sort of runner (I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby/rake"&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt; but you could use any scripting or Make-like language) that does whatever manipulation and calculation is needed, and passes in the necessary values distinct variable values (i.e. the full subnet list, and the unique subnet list, as separate variables). To make this even more difficult, though Terraform supports loading built-time variables from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCL&lt;/span&gt; file instead of the command line, it only supports taking in variables as strings (even in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;). So in our subnet example, our wrapper script needs to join the list of subnets into a string (i.e. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;) and then whenever we use the variable in Terraform, we need to &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; it on our separator character (because Terraform doesn&amp;#8217;t support variable setting or&amp;nbsp;manipulation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Terraform [has] no way to add this functionality&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m aware that I could fork Terraform, learn Go, and submit pull requests for all of the features I think would be useful; and if I had maybe half a dozen less unfinished projects, I&amp;#8217;d probably do that. However, this still means that HashiCorp would need to accept and merge my PRs and release a new version, or else I&amp;#8217;d need to build and distribute my forked version. Terraform supports &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/index.html"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;, but only for Providers and Provisioners, not language internals. What I&amp;#8217;d really like is a way to define plugin functions that could be distributed without having to rebuild all of&amp;nbsp;Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="no-interpolated-default-variable-values"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#no-interpolated-default-variable-values"&gt;No Interpolated Default Variable&amp;nbsp;Values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform variables can have default values defined for them. However, these default values have no way of using other variables. This means that even for relatively common use cases - like a service that has a name and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record, both of which can be overridden but with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record defaulting to &amp;#8220;SERVICE_NAME.example.com&amp;#8221;, you can&amp;#8217;t do that. The only options that I&amp;#8217;ve been able to figure out are to either do it in your wrapper script (which means the Terraform configs can&amp;#8217;t be run without the wrapper) or use the &lt;code&gt;coalesce&lt;/code&gt; function to give your variable an empty default value, and then choose a second interpolated string if the variable is&amp;nbsp;empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="no-conditionals"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#no-conditionals"&gt;No&amp;nbsp;Conditionals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform&amp;#8217;s configuration language also lacks conditional statements such as &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;. This poses a problem with all but the simplest applications, and is certainly likely to be an issue for anyone who wants to do the right thing and use the same tooling to deploy multiple environments. It seems that the only options are to either pass in the necessary information as variables from a wrapper script, or generate Terraform configurations with other tooling. The former works only if the desired result is a variable in your configuration; there&amp;#8217;s simply no way that I&amp;#8217;ve found to have a conditional around resource(s). The only obvious option for that is to take advantage of Terraform&amp;#8217;s ability to read configurations as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;, and simply generate your entire terraform configuration with another&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="terraform"></category><category term="hashicorp"></category><category term="AWS"></category><category term="go"></category></entry><entry><title>AwsLimitChecker - Check Your AWS Usage Against Service Limits</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2015/07/awslimitchecker-check-your-aws-usage-against-service-limits/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-25T08:35:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-07-25T08:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2015-07-25:/2015/07/awslimitchecker-check-your-aws-usage-against-service-limits/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Initial release of AwsLimitChecker, a tool to check your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; usage against service limits and Trusted&amp;nbsp;Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so, at my day job, we&amp;#8217;ve been leveraging &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; more and more, specifically
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt; to manage complete application stacks. One
side-effect of this is that we went through a few periods where we were constantly hitting various
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Service Limits - subnet groups, ElastiCache clusters, security groups, and a whole slew of others.
In pretty much all these cases, we weren&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; aware of the limits; we (the Tooling and
Automation team) had succeeded in our goal of handing our internal customers the tools to spin up
complete application environments, per-developer, on-demand. And it was wonderful until we hit some
magic number of CloudFormation stacks, at which point almost every day for a week or two we had to
open a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Support ticket to have a different limit increased, and deal with completely broken
deploys until that was done (or send out a frantic &amp;#8220;someone please delete a dev stack&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;email).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early last month we decided that we had to do something about this. As much as I tried, I couldn&amp;#8217;t
find an existing solution that would monitor our limits and alert us when we approached them; there
were some open source scripts that would do so for a handful of limits (generally just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; usage),
and the proprietary solutions that I was able to find didn&amp;#8217;t seem much better; none of them stated
that they handle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; or ElastiCache limits, which had been problematic for us. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s own
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/"&gt;Trusted Advisor&lt;/a&gt; has a Service Limits
check available to Business- and Enterprise-level support accounts, but it only monitors 17 of the
94 Service Limits that we identified as relevant to us, and it sends out &lt;em&gt;weekly&lt;/em&gt; alerts. So,
I decided to write something to solve the problem. My co-workers and I have been trying to get
corporate legal approval to release our work publicly under an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSI&lt;/span&gt;-approved license for years,
to no avail. I asked my team if they&amp;#8217;d support waiting a while for this work, so I could do it
entirely in my own time, publicly, under an open source license. Happily, they&amp;nbsp;agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m making the first release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/awslimitchecker"&gt;awslimitchecker&lt;/a&gt;,
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGPL&lt;/span&gt; 3.0-licensed Python tool to calculate your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; resource usage for various services bound by
&lt;a href="http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/limits.html#current-checks"&gt;service limits&lt;/a&gt;, and tell you which ones exceed a given threshold (actually, warning and critical
thresholds). Effective limits are hard-coded to the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html"&gt;published defaults&lt;/a&gt;,
but can be overridden in cases where you&amp;#8217;ve received limit increases, and will be automatically updated
from Trusted Advisor data for all limits that it monitors (if your account includes the full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; checks).
awslimitchecker provides warning and critical thresholds that can be set globally as a percentage of the
limit (defaults are 80% and 99%, respectively) or overridden on a per-limit basis, as either a percentage
or a fixed integer usage&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awslimitchecker is available &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awslimitchecker/0.1.0"&gt;from pypi&lt;/a&gt;.
It is compatible and tested with Python versions 2.6 through 3.4, though the library it uses to communicate
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;boto&lt;/a&gt;, still has a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; services which are not python3-compatible.
awslimitchecker includes both a Python module with a &lt;a href="http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/awslimitchecker.checker.html"&gt;documented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those who
don&amp;#8217;t mind working with Python, and a command line script for those who&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is still very young, and only being used by one organization, but it&amp;#8217;s proven
stable for us, and I&amp;#8217;m more than happy to accept questions, comments, criticisms,

It provides a Java daemon to read and parse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html"&gt;detailed billing reports&lt;/a&gt;
and a web interface to the data (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ice/blob/master/README.md#screenshots"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt;). The single biggest feature for us
is the ability to do cost breakdowns (by hour/day/week/month) based on Cost Allocation tags in the detailed billing reports. We tag every billable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;
resource with the Application Name, Service Class (environment; dev/test/prod) and Responsible Party. Ice lets us configure &amp;#8220;Application Groups&amp;#8221;
based on applications as seen from a business/budgetary standpoint and allow up-to-the-hour data on that available to anyone who needs&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spun up the development install of Ice for a few weeks to give it a spin, but once people started complaining that my screen session died and took
Ice with it, it was clear we needed a real, permanent installation. While there is &lt;a href="https://github.com/mdsol/ice_cookbook"&gt;chef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Answers4AWS/netflixoss-ansible"&gt;ansible&lt;/a&gt;
code to install and configure Ice, we&amp;#8217;re a Puppet shop, and there wasn&amp;#8217;t anything available that I could find for Puppet. So, I set about writing a
module to install and configure Ice, running in Tomcat behind an Nginx proxy. Like any good modern module, I wanted not only &lt;a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/"&gt;rspec-puppet&lt;/a&gt;
unit tests but also &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker"&gt;beaker&lt;/a&gt; acceptance tests. For those unfamiliar, Beaker is an acceptance testing framework for Puppet
that&amp;#8217;s similar to Test Kitchen; it spins up Vagrant machines, runs some code in them, and then uses &lt;a href="http://serverspec.org/"&gt;serverspec&lt;/a&gt; to make assertions about
the state of the system (file contents, running processes, command output, etc.) (side note: if you used Beaker prior to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/blob/master/HISTORY.md#beaker2.0.0"&gt;2.0 release&lt;/a&gt; in December 2014, you should really try it again; they&amp;#8217;ve made some great&amp;nbsp;improvements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-problem"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This posed a bit of a challenge, as Ice (in addition to being pretty poorly documented) is really designed to run in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;. Firstly, the very reason we started running Ice was
to get a handle on our fast-growing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; spend; as a result, we&amp;#8217;re trying hard not to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; for small-scale projects that could use existing resources. Second, while our
company very unfortunately doesn&amp;#8217;t have an open source policy and isn&amp;#8217;t releasing anything (hopefully this may be changing soon), we try hard to write generic, forge-quality&amp;nbsp;modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I wanted to use the default Vagrant/VirtualBox provider for Beaker. To make matters worse, in keeping with the spirit of a community module, I didn&amp;#8217;t
want the acceptance tests to require anything specific to my company, such as an S3 bucket preseeded with our billing data. Ice both reads the detailed billing reports
(one of its three inputs; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; pricing data and your accounts&amp;#8217; reservation pricing/capacity being the others) and writes state from and to S3. So, this was a bit difficult.
As we don&amp;#8217;t plan on upgrading Ice terribly often, and we wanted to install from the &lt;a href="https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/ice-master/"&gt;cloudbees master builds&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted
acceptance testing of not just the provisioning tooling, but also some basic smoke tests for the application&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-solution"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to come up with a working, albeit somewhat Rube Goldberg, method of getting isolated acceptance tests to work. What follows is the gist of how I got Ice
working in complete isolation. The majority of this happens in &lt;code&gt;spec/acceptance/0prerequisite_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt; which runs first and both does the prerequisite setup
and validates that everything is setup right and working for the tests. The following solution is based on the amazingly helpful &lt;a href="https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3"&gt;fakes3&lt;/a&gt;
Ruby gem, the &lt;a href="http://www.apsis.ch/pound/"&gt;Pound&lt;/a&gt; reverse proxy, and some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certificate trickery. While my code was specific to Beaker, this should be generic
enough to use with any system acceptance testing&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prerequisites"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#prerequisites"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we obtain or create some files that we&amp;#8217;ll need on the test&amp;nbsp;instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a relatively recent Detailed Billing With Resources and Tags zipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; report from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; account of yours (the filename is in the format
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ACCOUNT NUMBER&amp;gt;-aws-billing-detailed-line-items-with-resources-and-tags-&amp;lt;YYYY&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;MM&amp;gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt;). Manually trim it down to a sufficient sample of data;
    I took a few hours&amp;#8217; worth of data from one day and trimmed it down to just that referencing a few randomly chosen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instances, ELBs, on-demand &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;
    instances and reserved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances. I then anonymized the account number, resource IDs, tag values, and anything else identifying. Ice needs billing
    data in order to do anything, so this will serve as our test&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ice runs, it attempts to retrieve reserved instance pricing. It appears (I&amp;#8217;ve lost the mailing list or GitHub issue reference) that it&amp;#8217;s typical for
    the first Ice run on an empty S3 work directory to die because these files are missing. As a result, grab the &lt;code&gt;reservation_prices.oneyear.*&lt;/code&gt; files from
    the S3 work bucket of a running/working Ice installation. This will prevent a time-consuming shutdown of Ice on the first&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a self-signed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; key and certificate for &lt;code&gt;fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;. Package them together in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEM&lt;/span&gt; file suitable for use in web servers.
    (Note that most modern S3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; clients accept a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a bucket, as there are now third parties that implement the S3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Ice does not; it connects
    to https://&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUCKETNAME&lt;/span&gt;.s3amazonaws.com. As a result, this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; foolery is&amp;nbsp;required.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setup"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#setup"&gt;Setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/fakes3"&gt;fakes3&lt;/a&gt; rubygem; this provides an s3-compliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; backed by local filesystem storage.
    Configure it to run during your tests (I set it up as a systemd service, but there are certainly other ways to do this). Note that
    while fakes3 stores the uploaded data on the local filesystem, it maintains a mapping of known objects in memory; as such, the process
    always starts completely empty, regardless of what&amp;#8217;s in the backing directory on the filesystem. fakes3 allows all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; credentials,
    so fake ones are fine. It also automatically creates buckets the first time they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href="http://www.apsis.ch/pound/"&gt;pound&lt;/a&gt; reverse proxy and configure it to listen on port 443 with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEM&lt;/span&gt; file you generated
    earlier, and proxy to fakes3 (which listens by default on port 10000). The &lt;code&gt;ListenHTTPS&lt;/code&gt;section of &lt;code&gt;pound.cfg&lt;/code&gt; will need the
    &lt;code&gt;xHTTP 1&lt;/code&gt; directive in order to enable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; verbs other than&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup a local hosts file entry pointing &lt;code&gt;fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fakes3 starts, upload your sample billing data file and your reserved instance pricing files to the appropriate paths under a
    bucket called &amp;#8220;fakebucket&amp;#8221;. You can use a tool such as &lt;a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd"&gt;s3cmd&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate its contents, and other
    supported tools are listed in &lt;a href="https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3/wiki/Supported-Clients"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This step also serves
    to validate your Pound configuration, which should pass &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; port 443 traffic through to fakes3 and allow you to store and
    retrieve&amp;nbsp;objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out the path to the trusted keystore for the version of Java that you&amp;#8217;re running Ice under. On CentOS 7 with OpenJDK 1.7.0,
    this was (after a lot of symlinks) &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/cacerts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import your self-signed certificate into the Java keystore as a trusted certificate. This will allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; verification to succeed even
    with a self-signed&amp;nbsp;certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/bin/keytool -importcert -alias fakebucket -file fakebucket.s3.amazonaws.com.crt -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -trustcacerts -noprompt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;code&gt;ice.properties&lt;/code&gt; for the above. The important and unintuitive parts that I found&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going by the above examples, your billing and work S3 bucket names should both be&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;fakebucket&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to mock out bigger parts of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; metadata service, run Ice with
   &lt;code&gt;-Dice.s3AccessKeyId=NotAValidAccessKeyId -Dice.s3SecretKey=NotAValidAwsSecretKeyXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;
   in the &lt;code&gt;JAVA_OPTS&lt;/code&gt;. If Ice can&amp;#8217;t retrieve an instance&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; role from the metadata service
   (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/) and doesn&amp;#8217;t have the
   access and secret keys defined, it won&amp;#8217;t run. Also note that while the documentation is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
   unclear on this, a number of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ice/issues/49#issuecomment-23497701"&gt;github issues&lt;/a&gt;
   clarify that these need to be passed in as Java runtime options; they can&amp;#8217;t be put in the properties&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disable the Reservation Capacity Poller (&lt;code&gt;ice.reservationCapacityPoller=false&lt;/code&gt;). This service
   needs to connect to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, and will cause Ice to die if it&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For testing purposes, it&amp;#8217;s a lot simpler and less error-prone (as well as being a lot faster) to
   test the processor and reader separately - at least in serial instead of simultaneously in the same&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all this is done, running the Ice Processor should retrieve the billing file, process it, and write the processed data to the
fakes3 bucket. Running the Reader should display the data properly. So far I&amp;#8217;ve been unable to find any features (other than the
Reservation Capacity Poller, noted above) that don&amp;#8217;t work with this&amp;nbsp;setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;#8217;s related to Ice itself or ideas for acceptance testing isolated applications, I hope this can be of use to&amp;nbsp;someone&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="netflix"></category><category term="ice"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="beaker"></category><category term="acceptance testing"></category><category term="aws"></category><category term="s3"></category><category term="fakes3"></category><category term="testing"></category></entry><entry><title>AWS CloudFormation and RDS Snapshots</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/12/aws-cloudformation-and-rds-snapshots/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-15T09:29:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-12-15T09:29:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-12-15:/2014/12/aws-cloudformation-and-rds-snapshots/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some tips, tricks and non-intuitive information about working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; CloudFormation and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been working on spinning up a WordPress stack on Amazon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s intended to be a production application,
so it uses Multi-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt; and a few other tricks to try to achieve relatively high fault tolerance (nothing insane, still in one region). It uses
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosted MySQL service for the database, and the stacks are created with &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt;.
Using CloudFormation has been an utterly wonderful experience and being able to spin up an entire stack - multiple autoscaling web server
instances, a database, memcache, etc. with the click of a button in ~20 minutes - is as close to operations nirvana as I&amp;#8217;ve ever&amp;nbsp;gotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the last steps for me was to work on database backups and restoration; both restoring the production application&amp;#8217;s database to a
previous snapshot, and restoring a production database snapshot to a test or development stack. This took a few days of testing, and I
wasn&amp;#8217;t able to find much complete information on the nuances of it; there are also some pieces that are not intuitive and (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMO&lt;/span&gt;) not
documented well enough in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; docs. In short, it&amp;#8217;s horribly easy to blow away your entire database. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to attempt to document
some of what I learned, in the hope that it will benefit&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of this post I&amp;#8217;ve included some snippets from my CloudFormation template, which I make reference to. It&amp;#8217;s probably worth looking
through that, as I make reference to some of the names used in it. Also, to make sense of this, you should be familiar with the nomenclature used by CloudFormation,
such as the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html"&gt;template anatomy&lt;/a&gt; and the difference between
parameters and properties, and resources and&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m writing this in mid-December 2014. I&amp;#8217;ll make every effort to keep this updated as I continue working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s possible
that some of the problems described herein will be fixed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="deletionpolicy-snapshot"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#deletionpolicy-snapshot"&gt;DeletionPolicy&amp;nbsp;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFormation resources support a &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html"&gt;DeletionPolicy&lt;/a&gt;
attribute that says what to do to a resource when deleted. For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instances, &amp;#8220;Snapshot&amp;#8221; is an option, which takes a manual snapshot when the resource
is deleted (manual snapshots, unlike the automated daily ones, live on even after the instance is deleted). Be warned, this only takes effect when you
delete the &lt;strong&gt;entire stack&lt;/strong&gt;. If you make a change to one of the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html"&gt;DBInstance properties&lt;/a&gt;
that requires a &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html#update-replacement"&gt;resource replacement&lt;/a&gt; to
take effect, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance will be replaced with a new one, and all of the data and automatic snapshots from the old one will be deleted.
That last part deserves repeating: automatic snapshots (the daily ones created by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;) are tied to the instance; if the instance is replaced
by CloudFormation, you lose all automatic (backup) snapshots with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-policy-to-prevent-updates"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#stack-policy-to-prevent-updates"&gt;Stack Policy to Prevent&amp;nbsp;Updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; data loss from accidentally changing a property of the instance, it&amp;#8217;s wise to add a
&lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html"&gt;stack policy to prevent updates to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; resources&lt;/a&gt;.
This will prevent CloudFormation from making any changes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance at all. Once the stack policy
is in place, in order to make changes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance you would either need to set a temporary stack policy
to allow the update (see the &amp;#8220;Updating Protected Resources&amp;#8221; section of the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html"&gt;stack policy documentation&lt;/a&gt;)
or simply delete and re-create the stack (the recommended method, if it&amp;#8217;s feasible for&amp;nbsp;you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting a proper stack policy should prevent many of the pitfalls I describe below; however, for completeness,
I&amp;#8217;ve described how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; resources behave currently without a stack policy protecting them. The
&lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;::DBInstance resource documentation&lt;/a&gt;
describes which properties can be updated in-place (&amp;#8220;Update requires: No interruption&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;some interruptions&amp;#8221;)
and which trigger complete replacement of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance (&amp;#8220;Update requires:&amp;nbsp;replacement&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you try to update a protected resource through the &lt;code&gt;aws&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; tools, the update will appear to have worked, but the event
log on the stack will show the update denied and the update will be rolled&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="restoring-snapshots-and-dbname"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#restoring-snapshots-and-dbname"&gt;Restoring Snapshots and&amp;nbsp;DBName&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DBSnapshotIdentifier property on a MySQL &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance specifies a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; snapshot to restore into the instance. The DBName
property will create a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance with a single blank database of that name. This bears repeating again; if the DBName
property ever changes, your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance will be replaced with one with a new, blank database of that name.
When creating a MySQL &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance, you can specify either the &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; property, but not both;
if you attempt to specify both, you&amp;#8217;ll get an error, &amp;#8220;DBName must be null when Restoring for this&amp;nbsp;Engine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to restore a snapshot to a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance, you&amp;#8217;ll need to ensure that &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; is null (either not specified at all, or the special &lt;code&gt;AWS::NoValue&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html"&gt;pseudo parameter&lt;/a&gt;). In order
to do this automatically (and since NoValue/null can&amp;#8217;t be passed in as a template parameter), in the template snippet below I&amp;#8217;ve defined a
&lt;code&gt;UseDbSnapshot&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html"&gt;condition&lt;/a&gt;
that evaluates to true if the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not empty. In my &lt;code&gt;RDS::DBInstance&lt;/code&gt; resource,
I conditionally set (using &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-conditions.html#d0e42982"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fn::If&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)
the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; properties depending on the value of &lt;code&gt;UseDbSnapshot&lt;/code&gt;. The end result is that if the
&lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not empty, it is passed in as the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; property of the resource and
the &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; property is set to &lt;code&gt;AWS::NoValue&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; property is set to &lt;code&gt;AWS::NoValue&lt;/code&gt;
and the &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; parameter is passed in to the corresponding property on the resource (indicating to create a new blank database
of that&amp;nbsp;name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this a bit more, CloudFormation seems to have no introspection into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instances. The &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; parameter
exists only in CloudFormation itself, and is only evaluated as a diff from the previous template; if it changes,
CloudFormation spins up a completely new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance with a single blank database of that name. Whether or not
the value of &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; matches the database currently in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance (say, restored from a snapshot)
is not known by CloudFormation. In short, if you create an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance from a snapshot of a &amp;#8220;foo&amp;#8221; database
and then change the template to have a &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; of &amp;#8220;foo&amp;#8221;, CloudFormation will spin up a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance
with an empty &amp;#8220;foo&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="restoring-to-a-new-stack"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#restoring-to-a-new-stack"&gt;Restoring to a New&amp;nbsp;Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When restoring to a new stack (stack creation), specify the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; and make sure &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; is set
to &lt;code&gt;AWS::NoValue&lt;/code&gt; per the previous paragraph (condition in the template). Note that for the life of the stack, you
must continue specifying these parameters (or the &amp;#8220;use previous value&amp;#8221; option for them). Using my example template
below, if you restored into a new stack using the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter and then later updated the stack
and omitted that parameter (which, because of the condition, would set it to &lt;code&gt;NoValue&lt;/code&gt; and set the &lt;code&gt;DBName&lt;/code&gt; parameter
to its default value) the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance would be replaced with a new one with a blank&amp;nbsp;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, stack updates should always use the previous value for the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter; this can
be done through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console, or using the &lt;code&gt;aws&lt;/code&gt; command line tools and a parameter like: &lt;code&gt;--parameters ParameterKey=DBSnapshotIdentifier,UsePreviousValue=true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="restoring-to-an-existing-stack"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#restoring-to-an-existing-stack"&gt;Restoring to an Existing&amp;nbsp;Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restoring a snapshot to an existing stack is a bit more nuanced. You can&amp;#8217;t restore a snapshot to an existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance,
you can only restore to a new instance. If you do this through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Console, you&amp;#8217;ll end up with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance disconnected
from your CloudFormation stack. So the way to do this is more or less the same as restoring to a new stack - specify
the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter for your template, and it will create a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance with the snapshot. The same
rules about using previous values for the parameters hold true. If you used a stack policy to prevent updates to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;
instance, you&amp;#8217;ll need to override that with a temporary policy when doing the&amp;nbsp;restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats to keep in mind with this procedure. The first, obviously, is that there may be some application downtime
when the existing database is replaced with the new (restored) one, and any writes will obviously be lost. Also, this only
works on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instances that were created with DBName or a &lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; snapshot. In order to restore the same snapshot to
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; resource a second time, you need to first update with the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; parameter removed and have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;
instance re-created with an empty database, and then update again with the &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt; in order to do the restore.
This is because CloudFormation doesn&amp;#8217;t reconcile the current state of instances to determine which actions to take, it only diffs
the updated template against the existing one. If the existing template and the updated one have the same value for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance&amp;#8217;s
properties (specifically &lt;code&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier&lt;/code&gt;), CloudFormation determines there are no changes, and does&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="launchconfig-metadata-issues"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#launchconfig-metadata-issues"&gt;LaunchConfig Metadata&amp;nbsp;Issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances I&amp;#8217;m using for this project are &amp;#8220;baked&amp;#8221; AMIs (built with &lt;a href="https://packer.io/"&gt;packer.io&lt;/a&gt;) in an Auto-Scaling Group (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASG&lt;/span&gt;).
They use a &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-launchconfig.html"&gt;LaunchConfig&lt;/a&gt; to write
out a file on disk with the database connection information for the application. In addition, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASG&lt;/span&gt; has an &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html"&gt;UpdatePolicy&lt;/a&gt;
designed to perform rolling updates (termination and replacement) of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances when their properties&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my testing, I noticed a number of times where updates to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; resource that triggered creation of a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance - such as restoring from
a snapshot in an existing stack, or changing the DBName - properly triggered an update of the LaunchConfig, but failed to trigger
the rolling update of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances. This left the application in a state where one or more (sometimes all) of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;
instances couldn&amp;#8217;t connect to the database, because the file written out by the LaunchConfig still contained the old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; connection
information. For non-production stacks where the entire stack can be deleted and recreated instead of updating the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; resource,
this shouldn&amp;#8217;t be an issue. Otherwise, if changes are made that replace the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance, I&amp;#8217;d recommend watching for the
LaunchConfig update completion, and manually terminating instances (or increasing the size of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASG&lt;/span&gt; to add instances)
to ensure that the running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances have the updated&amp;nbsp;LaunchConfig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to use the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-hup.html"&gt;cfn-hup daemon&lt;/a&gt; to
listen for stack updates that cause changes in resource metadata, and perform the required actions without needing the rolling update
to replace the&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently using the &lt;code&gt;aws&lt;/code&gt; command line tools to perform stack creation and updates,
wrapped in a Rakefile (I plan on changing this to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/boto/boto"&gt;boto&lt;/a&gt;
inside a &lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; job). What follows is a quick high-level guide
on how to accomplish various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt;-related tasks, using the template snippet&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a new stack using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; snapshot and a stack policy to prevent updates&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ cat /tmp/stack_policy.json
&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Statement&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Effect&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Deny&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Action&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Update:*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Principal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Resource&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;LogicalResourceId/DBInstance&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Effect&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Allow&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Action&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Update:*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Principal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Resource&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name mystack --stack-policy-body file:///tmp/stack_policy.json --template-body file:///home/myuser/cloudformation_template.json --parameters &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ParameterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier,ParameterValue&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;my-snapshot-identifier&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporarily override stack policy to allow updates&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a file with the following contents (we&amp;#8217;ll assume it&amp;#8217;s at &lt;code&gt;/home/myuser/allow_all_updates.json&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;Statement&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;Effect&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Allow&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;Action&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Update:*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;Principal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;Resource&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following &lt;code&gt;aws&lt;/code&gt; commands, append &lt;code&gt;--stack-policy-during-update-body file:///home/myuser/allow_all_updates.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update a stack (built using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; snapshot), without losing data&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-body file:///home/myuser/cloudformation_template.json --parameters &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ParameterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier,UsePreviousValue&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; snapshot into an existing stack&lt;/strong&gt; (that isn&amp;#8217;t already using this&amp;nbsp;snapshot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-body file:///home/myuser/cloudformation_template.json --parameters &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ParameterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier,ParameterValue&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;my-snapshot-identifier&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; snapshot into an existing stack again&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. restore from the same snapshot a second time; this one is a&amp;nbsp;kludge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# re-create the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; instance with a blank &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; (DBName)&lt;/span&gt;
$ aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-body file:///home/myuser/cloudformation_template.json --parameters &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ParameterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier,ParameterValue&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
$ &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# then load the snapshot again&lt;/span&gt;
$ aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-body file:///home/myuser/cloudformation_template.json --parameters &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ParameterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;DBSnapshotIdentifier,ParameterValue&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;my-snapshot-identifier&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cloudformation-template-snippet"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#cloudformation-template-snippet"&gt;CloudFormation Template&amp;nbsp;Snippet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means complete, but just includes the parameters, conditions, and resources which I make reference&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;DBSnapshotIdentifier&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

about a script I wrote to send &lt;a href="https://pushover.net/"&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; notifications for shell command&amp;nbsp;completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing quite a bit of work lately both with testing some &lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; jobs, and spinning up
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; stacks using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt;. Last week I wrote two python scripts to aid in&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/watch_cloudformation.py"&gt;watch_cloudformation.py&lt;/a&gt; uses the popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/boto/boto"&gt;boto&lt;/a&gt;
Python &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; interface to list (and display) the events on a specified CloudFormation stack, and exit 0 or 1 when it finds a (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;)_(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAILED&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/span&gt;) event.
It also optionally uses &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pushover"&gt;python-pushover&lt;/a&gt; to send the notification to your devices via&amp;nbsp;Pushover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/watch_jenkins.py"&gt;watch_jenkins.py&lt;/a&gt; takes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to a Jenkins job or build, and uses
&lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-jenkins"&gt;python-jenkins&lt;/a&gt; to poll the status of the build (or the latest build, if given a Job url)
and display the result when the build finishes, also optionally using python-pushover to send notifications to your&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re really quick-and-dirty scripts and might not be suitable for everyone&amp;#8217;s use case, but I took the time to write them,
so hopefully they&amp;#8217;ll be useful to someone&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="script"></category><category term="pushover"></category><category term="jenkins"></category><category term="hudson"></category><category term="aws"></category><category term="cloudformation"></category></entry><entry><title>Managing EC2 SSH Keys - An Idea</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/10/managing-ec2-ssh-keys-an-idea/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-04T11:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-10-04T11:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-10-04:/2014/10/managing-ec2-ssh-keys-an-idea/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An idea on how to manage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; keys for a large number of&amp;nbsp;users&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work, we have a bunch of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances (currently hundreds, and growing quickly). We also have a bunch
(probably now around 100, counting contractors) of users. Some users - mainly engineers - need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access to all
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances; many others only need access to their team&amp;#8217;s instances. While I usually advocate sanity checks
and training over access control for employees, many teams have expressed legitimate concern that they don&amp;#8217;t want
others on their instances; commands that are safe to run in dev/test (like loading test data) might be disastrous
on production instances. So, as part of our automation and tooling team, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to come up with a way to manage
access to all these instances. Right now we have a single &amp;#8220;bastion&amp;#8221; (a.k.a. jump box / ssh gateway / keyhole) instance, with a single
shared used keyed to access every &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance; that doesn&amp;#8217;t scale and doesn&amp;#8217;t meet the security&amp;nbsp;requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is one theory of mine on how to solve this problem. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about this for the past
day; this might not be the Right answer, and it&amp;#8217;s just a theory at this point, but I think it&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="requirements-and-assumptions"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#requirements-and-assumptions"&gt;Requirements and&amp;nbsp;Assumptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have Active Directory as the one source of authentication/authorization truth, but it&amp;#8217;s only in the corporate
  network. For various reasons both technical and political, accessing it from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; (whether directly, over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;,
  via replication, or via data feeds to a separate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;) is simply not&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to control &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access to a bunch of instances. Some of them are persistent and some are ephemeral. Some
  are pre-baked AMIs in auto-scaling groups, with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; changes made outside the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt;. Some of them are persistent
  or semi-persistent instances that run Puppet every 30 minutes. Some of them are somewhat special, and can&amp;#8217;t be
  trivially torn&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of our instances are in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt;, and have proper security controls which include &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access from only a specifically
  white-listed range of IPs. However, some instances are in &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; Classic&amp;#8221; and have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; open to the world. We want a
  solution that also protects these&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;re mainly concerned with securing access from (a) users inadvertently accessing an instance they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be
  on, (b) outside/untrusted parties, and (c) former employees. We trust our employees within reason, and accept that,
  within our security stance, if an employee &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants privilege escalation, they&amp;#8217;re going to get it. We&amp;#8217;re not
  overly concerned with protecting against determined, malicious users who already have some access but want&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our current process for security cleanup for former employees is largely based on corporate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; (or is it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt;?) turning
  off their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; account. We want to minimize additional steps that need to be completed when someone has access&amp;nbsp;revoked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any solution that we choose needs to be usable with self-service &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;; i.e. any user can spin up their own instances
  or stacks, provided that they use an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt; that is either built by our automation team, or follows guidelines on what
  must be included in all&amp;nbsp;AMIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have some administrative accounts (Jenkins, as well as some shared privileged accounts on select machines) that need
  unrestricted access to&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local user accounts aren&amp;#8217;t an option. This would mean running Puppet constantly on every image and/or rebuilding
  every image each time we gain or lose an employee. That would be especially difficult when we occasionally have
  project-based&amp;nbsp;contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;re &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with having a bastion/keyhole server in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, we just don&amp;#8217;t want everyone to be able to access&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our intended network security stance is to have bastion/keyhole servers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; (ideally one per &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt;), which are only
  reachable via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; from selected public addresses on our corporate network (which can only be reached by current
  employees with valid, working access). All other instances should only allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; from these selected&amp;nbsp;hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the above, we don&amp;#8217;t want to rely on an instance being properly configured as our only security measure;
  if an instance is incorrectly configured to accept &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; from 0.0.0.0/0, we still want to prevent users whose
  access has been revoked from logging in to the&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t need access to be granted and revoked immediately. We&amp;#8217;ll assume that in normal operating conditions,
  thirty (30) minutes is a reasonable amount of time to either grant or revoke a user&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to minimize reliance on our existing corporate infrastructure, so that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; can be used for business
  continuity&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="main-goals"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#main-goals"&gt;Main&amp;nbsp;Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide users with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; servers; privilege should be able to be granted to a subset of users and/or groups
  for each &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221;. Users should not be able to access other&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow a fixed list of users access to every&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to revoke a user&amp;#8217;s access without rebuilding instances or ssh-in-a-loop&amp;#8217;ing to all of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many instances are not going to be running Puppet after initial provisioning/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt; creation, so as much as we love Puppet,
  it&amp;#8217;s not an option to solve this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This should involve a minimum of administrative overhead when a user leaves the&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="proposed-solution"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#proposed-solution"&gt;Proposed&amp;nbsp;Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution relies on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; agent forwarding and the &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt; introduced in OpenSSH 6.2 (see &amp;#8220;Limitations&amp;#8221;, below, for more information),
most likely inspired by (or maybe literally the same code)
as the patch formerly used by GitHub. This allows sshd to execute an arbitrary command, passing it the login username, which returns output identical to what would
be in the &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file. If none of the keys successfully authenticate the user, authentication continues using the usual &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysFile&lt;/code&gt;. We take
advantage of this feature, in addition to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; agent forwarding, to provide our granular access control. Public keys are pulled from a central location &lt;em&gt;at login time&lt;/em&gt;
(and cached for a set amount of time); each user has control over their own public keys, and a central process builds sets of public keys authorized to access a given
group of&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#infrastructure"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance will be a member of an Access Group, which is a unique identifier for the set of users authorized to access instances
in the group. In implementation, Access Groups will likely just be a tag on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances that maps to a set of predefined values
(see below for&amp;nbsp;more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have a number of &amp;#8220;bastion&amp;#8221; (keyhole/jump box/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; gateway) hosts, ideally one in each Availability Zone where we have instances.
These bastion hosts will only be reachable from within our corporate network (or our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;); therefore, users must have
current access to our corporate network (where we can rely on Active Directory and other systems to handle authorization) in order to
gain access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;. All other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances will only be reachable over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; from one of these bastion hosts. The bastion hosts themselves
will not have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; keys to access other instances; they will, however, have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; agent forwarding&amp;nbsp;enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users reach &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; instances by SSHing from a host attached to our corporate network (including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; hosts) to a bastion host in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;. From there,
they &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; to the destination instance, making use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; agent forwarding to use their local key to authenticate to the instance. We get both
a restricted entry point to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; (the bastion host, which can enforce further security and logging methods) and the ability to authenticate users
using their own personal public keys on the destination&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier for end-users, we could develop a wrapper script like &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ec2-ssh"&gt;Instagram&amp;#8217;s ec2-ssh&lt;/a&gt; that
checks for a valid, running ssh agent with keys in it, and then crafts the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; command to land the user on the desired end
host - i.e. something like &lt;code&gt;ec2ssh instance_id&lt;/code&gt; would generate and execute a command like &lt;code&gt;ssh -At bastion_hostname 'ssh instance_ip'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-the-servers-instances"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#on-the-servers-instances"&gt;On the Servers&amp;nbsp;(Instances)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each instance, when initially built/provisioned, is given a &lt;code&gt;get_authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; script, which is configured to be run by sshd as the
&lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt;. This script uses one of the following three public key distribution services to retrieve the authorized public keys
for that instance, which are then echoed on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt; and used to authenticate the user. For the sake of simplicity, we&amp;#8217;ll assume (which is
currently the case in our infrastructure) that this script will only run for a single non-root user that is used for logins; it will exit
without returning any output for any other users on the system, effectively preventing logins to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script will first check for authorized keys cached locally (either on disk or in memory, to be determined). If they&amp;#8217;re found and less
than some age threshold (we&amp;#8217;ll say five minutes), the cached version is returned. This is intended to both reduce latency when performing
multiple sequential logins, and to allow logins to continue functioning through short periods of degraded network connectivity. If no recent
keys are found cached on disk, the script will retrieve them from the configured public key distribution service. If the service does not
return an appropriate response within an acceptable time limit, or is unreachable, the script will exit with no output. This will prevent
logins from users authorized with this method, but will fall through to the standard &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysFile&lt;/code&gt; method. A number of permanent
authorized public keys will be included in each instance, to allow emergency administrative access in the event that the key distribution
service&amp;nbsp;fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#8217;re willing to assume that the instances themselves are trusted (which I think is a valid assumption), the key retrieval script on
each instance will determine the Access Group that the instance belongs to, and then request the authorized keys for that Access Group.
Determination of Access Group will likely be made via user data passed into the instance at provisioning time, or via retrieval of a
tag value for the&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If assuming trust locally on the instance is not sufficient, then the burden of identifying the instance&amp;#8217;s access group is shifted
to the key distribution service (likely by identifying the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address of the requesting instance, and then using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to
determine which group that instance belongs to). With this solution, only the second alternative key distribution service is&amp;nbsp;feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shorter delay to authorization changes is needed, it would be feasible for instances to also run a separate process
(cronjob, daemon, etc.) that polls the key distribution service at a regular interval to check for updates (i.e.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;, something &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;-based, etc.) and updates the local cache when they&amp;nbsp;occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="public-key-distribution-service"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#public-key-distribution-service"&gt;Public Key Distribution&amp;nbsp;Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances will retrieve their authorized public keys from a key distribution service. Three examples&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternative-1-scalable-architecture-aws-and-local"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alternative-1-scalable-architecture-aws-and-local"&gt;Alternative 1 - Scalable Architecture - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;Local&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys will be managed by a web-based application (with a complete and documented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;) living in the corporate data center.
The application will provide facilities for authorized users (managers, operations) to define new Access Groups and modify
the list of users allowed to access them. Individual end-users will be able to manage their public keys. At a set interval,
a standalone script will retrieve a list of all users defined in the application and check the status of their corporate Active
Directory accounts. Any users whose accounts have been deactivated or locked will be flagged as such in the application. Whenever
a change is made in the application (including a user being flagged as deactivated), all Access Groups that include that user
will have their authorized_keys file (composed of the authorized_keys files of all users with access) written to an S3 bucket
that&amp;#8217;s only writable by the privileged
user running the application. All instances will have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; roles that allow them to read the&amp;nbsp;bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method allows us to provide self-service to users and application administrators, and keeps all data about users within
the corporate network. It provides automatic revocation of access for disabled Active Directory accounts. It does introduce
a delay in revocation of access for disabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; accounts, but a delay of ~10 minutes is certainly not a concern in our&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternative-2-scalable-architecture-entirely-in-aws"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alternative-2-scalable-architecture-entirely-in-aws"&gt;Alternative 2 - Scalable Architecture Entirely in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar application exists, but lives entirely in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, utilizing its native high availability technologies (i.e. multi-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDS&lt;/span&gt; as a data store). A script still runs in the corporate data center, but all it does is query the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for a list of all
active users, check &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; account status, and deactivate any users that no longer have a valid account. Instead of writing the
authorized key files to an S3 bucket, the application serves them directly in real-time. The application could
store keys and data in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDBMS&lt;/span&gt;, or perhaps something like OpenLDAP, depending on which technologies are best known and
what the performance requirements&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of an infrastructure challenge and introduces additional points for failure; if the application above (1)
fails, it will only impact &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; to access, whereas if this application fails, all user access (aside from the static
emergency keys) will break. However, this method allows us to control access at a level finer than Access Groups; rules
could be developed based on any attributes of the requesting instance, including (if the latency was allowable) queries
to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for instance-specific&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alternative-3-simple-architecture"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alternative-3-simple-architecture"&gt;Alternative 3 - Simple&amp;nbsp;Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A text file stores mappings of Access Groups to the Active Directory users and groups authorized for them. The text file
is manually maintained, stored in version control, and all changes must comply with an access policy and be peer-reviewed.
A script runs at a set interval (let&amp;#8217;s say cron every 5-10 minutes) that reads the user/group mapping, translates groups
to their membership list, and checks the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; account status of every listed user. Users without valid/current/enabled accounts
are removed from the lists in memory. For the remaining (active) users for each Access Group, their &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;
file is read. All user&amp;#8217;s authorized_keys files are concatenated together per Access Group, and the result is written to
an S3&amp;nbsp;bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far the simplest method, and relies on our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFS&lt;/span&gt; shared home directories to allow users to manage their public
keys by simply using the standard file. This keeps all user-related data in our corporate data center, and means that we
have only one script and its&amp;#8217; cron job to maintain, rather than a whole application. The text-file-based method of access
control isn&amp;#8217;t terribly scalable, but it should work for the ~100 users that we have to deal with. Checking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; account status
when generating the file should provide a feasible safeguard for users whose corporate accounts are locked/revoked without
requiring someone to remember to also remove them from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; user&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advantages-over-other-solutions"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#advantages-over-other-solutions"&gt;Advantages Over Other&amp;nbsp;Solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-service for users and for managers/administrators of&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No manual intervention when a user leaves the company; users automatically deactivated when their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; account&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No cron job or daemon to run on instances, and no centralized process to break key distribution; each instance
  automatically pulls the current authorized keys when a login is&amp;nbsp;attempted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t depend on Puppet, so it allows individual applications to use Puppet as they desire, without complication
  or&amp;nbsp;confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only depends on centralized (corporate data center) infrastructure for key updates (at most). Failure of connectivity
  between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; and the corporate data center can be worked around assuming there is an alternate path of access (such as
  a bastion host that allows logins from engineers/managers from a trusted outside&amp;nbsp;host).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of access can be delegated to application owners/managers, while still allowing engineers full&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the strength of public key authentication; no passwords to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensures that select static trusted keys always have access to instances, even during a failure of the key distribution&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In emergencies, keys could be distributed directly to the authorized_keys file, bypassing the distribution system,
  or key file cache lifetime could be&amp;nbsp;increased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be easily audited by having a scheduled job add a key for all instances, wait ~15 minutes, and then attempt &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;
  connections to all&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trade-offs"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#trade-offs"&gt;Trade-Offs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delay between user access addition/removal and updates (though this can be minimized by a shorter cache&amp;nbsp;time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency during initial login with a cold&amp;nbsp;cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addition of another system that could&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="limitations"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My company is a CentOS shop. The &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt; feature of OpenSSH itself was only released in &lt;a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.2"&gt;OpenSSH 6.2&lt;/a&gt;,
on March 22, 2013. A patch for it was backported to the 5.3p1 version of openssh-server in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt; and CentOS 6. However,
this method will certainly not work on CentOS 5, which is still running OpenSSH 4.3. Be aware that when the new &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt;
feature was backported, the man page was not updated; &lt;code&gt;man sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; is still conspicuously missing these options, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t
find anything in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; changelog about it, but the &lt;code&gt;openssh-5.3p1-authorized-keys-command.patch&lt;/code&gt; file is clearly there in the
5.3p1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRPM&lt;/span&gt;, and the options are there but commented out in the &lt;code&gt;sshd_config&lt;/code&gt; it provides. I actually thought this would be near-impossible
to do on CentOS 6 until I found the &lt;code&gt;openssh-ldap&lt;/code&gt; package (in the default repos) and discovered that it uses this&amp;nbsp;feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this solution requires (depending on which alternative is chosen) working access to either S3 or instances serving an application.
Assuming proper configuration (and distribution across AZs) this should be a&amp;nbsp;non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="accountability"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#accountability"&gt;Accountability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If accountability is a concern, we will handle this through detailed logging in every step of the key creation, authorization, distribution
and retrieval process. In addition, all instances will run sshd with &lt;code&gt;LogLevel VERBOSE&lt;/code&gt;, which will log the fingerprint of all public keys
used to connect to the instance. Logs will be written to a secure, append-only&amp;nbsp;medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="references-and-further-details"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#references-and-further-details"&gt;References and Further&amp;nbsp;Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an existing &lt;code&gt;openssh-ldap&lt;/code&gt; package in CentOS that provides instructions on setting up public key storage in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; backend,
  using &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://andriigrytsenko.net/2013/05/authorizedkeyscommand-support-and-centosrhel-5-x/"&gt;Someone said&lt;/a&gt; they successfully built the current
  6.2 OpenSSH for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt;/Cent&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance can retrieve its own tags using tools such as &lt;code&gt;awscli&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ec2-api-tools&lt;/code&gt; and an appropriate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAM&lt;/span&gt; role set on the&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="rejected-ideas"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#rejected-ideas"&gt;Rejected&amp;nbsp;Ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thinking through this I considered and rejected a number of alternate methods. Here are some of&amp;nbsp;them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s relatively new Certificate support (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;-based) sounds nice, it doesn&amp;#8217;t solve the problem; according to
  &lt;a href="http://neocri.me/documentation/using-ssh-certificate-authentication/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; it uses a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; to sign keys,
  but doesn&amp;#8217;t do a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRL&lt;/span&gt; lookup, it relies on a RevokedKeys file manually sync&amp;#8217;ed to all servers. So, this poses the
  same problem as managing authorized_keys as a file distributed to&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing per-application users or groups on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; bastion hosts requires a lot of administrative overhead, and isn&amp;#8217;t really an option for us.
  Though this would be a simple implementation using either groups for each application with private keys group-readable,
  or using per-application users and the proper sudo&amp;nbsp;configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to finding out about &lt;code&gt;AuthorizedKeysCommand&lt;/code&gt;, my top idea was essentially this same implementation on the
  key distribution server side, but writing it to an S3 bucket, and running a cronjob on each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance to pull
  down the authorized_keys&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Don&amp;#8217;t - See &lt;a href="https://wblinks.com/notes/aws-tips-i-wish-id-known-before-i-started/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;
  as a reference. But the gist is, &amp;#8220;If you have to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into your servers, then your automation has failed&amp;#8221;.
  Sure, development and test stacks will be spun up, probably with either a single user&amp;#8217;s key, or a shared
  key. But after that (i.e. in prod), instances are cattle. Logs should be shipped to a central store, CloudWatch
  and/or other monitoring technologies (i.e. NewRelic, Diamond to graphite) should get most of the data that&amp;#8217;s
  needed. I&amp;#8217;m not seriously agreeing to &lt;strong&gt;disable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access, but to put in place the tools that it&amp;#8217;s needed
  so rarely (on non-dev instances) that it&amp;#8217;s feasible to ask one of a small group of privileged people to
  perform the&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust our users - If someone can push to master, full control of our systems is just a backtick (or popen) away.
  Recognize that if someone wasn&amp;#8217;t trustworthy, we wouldn&amp;#8217;t hire them. Let everyone access a single bastion host.
  Discourage unauthorized use via strong password policies and other standard security measures
  (perhaps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt;-based two-factor authentication). Discourage malicious use via detailed audit logging, with logs
  shipped to an append-only secure storage&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUID&lt;/span&gt; wrapper script - All users have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; access to a bastion host as their normal
  active directory user. They run a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUID&lt;/span&gt; wrapper script that has a list of which users are allowed to access
  which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances (or security groups, subnets, etc). When the user calls this script, it checks if the
  specified host is in a group they&amp;#8217;re allowed to access, and if so, SSHes to that host using a key only readable
  by the owner of the script. This is somewhat complex; there&amp;#8217;s a good possibility of security issues with the
  script itself, and it means that we&amp;#8217;re probably only allowing interactive logins - we&amp;#8217;re limited by the
  capabilities of the wrapper script, it&amp;#8217;s not just a normal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Pushing- A script runs in one central location. It has a mapping of which users/groups are allowed
  to access which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instances. Every X minutes the script runs. It grabs &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; for all
  users that are allowed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; access, and then generates an authorized_keys file for each group of instances.
  The script checks a cache, and if the file has changed for a group of instances since the last run, it queries
  the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to determine which instances are in that group, and distributes the authorized_keys file to them.
  The &amp;#8220;distributes&amp;#8221; part would, unfortunately, probably have to be&amp;nbsp;scp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bastion host per application. Users are allowed access to this host either via authorized_keys managed by Puppet,
  or via sudoers rules on a bastion host in the corporate network. But yeah, we&amp;#8217;d end up with a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various thoughts around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; in the cloud, replicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; in the cloud, OpenLDAP in the cloud pulling from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt;, or
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;. These were all rejected either because of corporate security policies, or because relying on internal
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt; for authentication would mean that a data center or connectivity failure also affects&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puppet - We actually &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; puppet on every instance. Maybe against our master, maybe masterless with a script
  to deploy some modules before every run. At a minimum, it manages ssh authorized keys for ec2_user. We implement
  some method where each user has a manifest with their own public keys, that they can maintain. Managers can add users
  to the group(s) for their applications, and that users&amp;#8217; keys are automatically deployed. Revoking keys, on the other
  hand, is a bigger problem. This requires some sort of &amp;#8220;this person is going away&amp;#8221; procedure, which currently doesn&amp;#8217;t
  exist (or involve the groups who maintain &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure), and would be one more thing for a human to forget.
  There are also instances that have &amp;#8220;special stuff&amp;#8221; going on with Puppet that would complicate&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a list of authorized keys, turn it into a manifest, and run puppet masterless on it via a cronjob (pulling
  the manifest from S3). This involves most of the same problems as above, plus means that we have Puppet running
  in two different ways on some instances (triggered via mco against a master, and cron&amp;#8217;ed in apply&amp;nbsp;mode).&lt;/li&gt;
