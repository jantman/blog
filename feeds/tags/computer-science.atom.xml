On the
futility of a Computer Science major. Specifically, on the fact that the
overwhelming odds are that in a career in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;, system administration, or
even web programming, I&amp;#8217;ll probably never apply 90% of what I learn in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I went looking for online certificate programs, knowing that most of
the vendors&amp;#8217; programs run $500 or more just for testing. I came by
eCertificates.com. And this brings me to another topic&amp;#8230; I clicked on
the &amp;#8220;Software Programming&amp;#8221; category, and was surprised to see no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
test. On a hunch, I looked under &amp;#8220;Web Design&amp;#8221;, and sure enough, there it&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a common misconception, and I know that because it plays
so well with the web, and Apache, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; has been pigeonholed as a web
language. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just crazy, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just because I know &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
better than anything else. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a web programming language.
It is a programming language that happens to work &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well with web&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;fread()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fwrite()&lt;/code&gt; I can slam together a command-line menu-based
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script for administration quicker than I could write the def&amp;#8217;s for a
Python script. I&amp;#8217;ve done it, I have a number of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;-based scripts
running on my machines. Database access with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; is a no-brainer. And
one day, when I get around to reading my &amp;#8220;ancient&amp;#8221; pile of books and
learning NCurses, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; will be right there with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess it is just a fact of the modern web mentality. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; has
myriad uses aside from web applications and web content handling. Sure,
my web site is written in it. But one of my backup scripts is, too. And
more importantly, if I&amp;#8217;m working with a database that already has a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;-based web frontend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; seems like the natural choice for a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;-based administration&amp;nbsp;backend.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="command line"></category><category term="computer science"></category><category term="PHP"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="web programming"></category></entry></feed>
