                <p>Well, I&#8217;ve been pretty busy lately, between school work and work for Sun
and Rutgers. Rutgers seems to be planning a new student lab, so I&#8217;ll
probably have a hand in that. And I&#8217;m now doing troubleshooting and
on-site support for RUwired and the Smart Classrooms. It&#8217;s a big step
down from programming web apps, but quite refreshing to have a job that
gets me out of the dungeon now and&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also planning my first tech demo as the Sun Campus Ambassador, which
will tentatively be held on December 4th at the
<a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu"><span class="caps">RUSLUG</span></a> meeting. Stay tuned for&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>In other news, unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t gotten my surplus from Rutgers
yet. I&#8217;m sitting here in my cube, staring at a pile of equipment with
nowhere to go. I just hope that this works out next week so I&#8217;ll have
some time to play around on Thanksgiving&nbsp;weekend.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was reading an
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=926">article</a> that I saw on Digg
about WalMart&#8217;s $200 Linux-based computer. What a great idea.
Admittedly, I shop at WalMart now and then (well, I&#8217;m in college) and
one line got me a bit:<br>
&#8220;The gPC is built using tiny components, but put inside a full-size case
because research indicates that Wal-Mart shoppers are so unsophisticated
they equate physical size with capability.&#8221;<br>
Though I&#8217;ll admit that it&#8217;s probably true. The author seemed to think
that Linux may have found its&#8217; niche, and was even bold enough to say
that, &#8220;While the price of hardware has fallen dramatically, the price of
Windows hasn’t. This could be Microsoft’s Achilles’ Heel.&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, ahmen. I&#8217;ve been mentioning that for quite a while now, as many
others have. We&#8217;ve reached the point where Microsoft Windows and
Microsoft Office is considerably more expensive than the computer that
they run on. OEMs like Dell are selling Linux-based PCs (granted they
aren&#8217;t really advertising them, and I didn&#8217;t see any mention of them
when I glanced through their Home/Home Office lineup), and even WalMart
is selling Linux-based systems. What I wonder, though, is how long it
will take mainstream consumers to look at two shiny little CDs,
befuddled that they cost more than a whole computer, and wonder what
other options there&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>To go off on a tangent for a moment, yesterday I took delivery of a
beautiful Wastern Digital My Book external hard drive. It&#8217;s the first
one I&#8217;ve bought in almost three years, since my LaCiE (<span class="caps">F.A.</span> Porsche
design) disk croaked on me and took 100 <span class="caps">GB</span> of photo scans with it. This
one, a My Book Premium <span class="caps">ES</span>, is a 500 <span class="caps">GB</span> disk in a 3-pound-ish box, which
cost $150 with shipping. I remember the first time I saw a writable <span class="caps">DVD</span>,
when I was doing an internship in video postproduction. They kept the
blanks locked up. I don&#8217;t think I ever would have imagined paying $150
to have half a terabyte in the palm of my hand. Anyway, the great thing
about this model is that it has a 3.0 Gbps eSATA connector, so it can
easily be used as *fast* exteral storage. So, once I got it, I set
about backing up my laptop. Hopefully by this time tomorrow, I&#8217;ll have a
laptop that dual-boots openSuSE 10.1 (pure 64-bit) and OpenSolaris <span class="caps">SXDE</span>&nbsp;9/07.</p>
<p>Back on topic, I&#8217;m totally enthused that Linux is finally making headway
in the desktop market. However, a few minutes ago, sitting here at my
desk, I was struck with panic. The same type of panic that would hit a
driving instructor if he sent his student out in a car and then realized
the poor kid didn&#8217;t know there was a brake. Linux is a multi-user
operating system. At its&#8217; heart, it&#8217;s designed to be a server-bound
Unix. And all of a sudden it struck me that people are downloading
Ubuntu or some other easy-to-use distro, and nobody told them where the
brake&nbsp;is!</p>
<p>I doubt that most new Linux users know what I (or any experienced user)
take(s) for granted. I&#8217;d hope that Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t enable <span class="caps">SSH</span> by default,
but I don&#8217;t know. But, realistically, how people who &#8220;try&#8221; Ubuntu
because it&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; (as in free beer) understand administration and
security of Linux systems? If they run <span class="caps">SSH</span>, do they know to run
something like <a href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">denyhosts</a>? Do they
even know what system logs are or where they are found, let alone check
them? Do they understand file checksumming, and something like
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/">Tripwire</a>? More importantly,
do they understand the power of their system, and how much it could do
without their&nbsp;knowledge?</p>
<p>Many security experts have conjectured that the lack of Linux viruses is
simply because Linux has such a low market share. However, with no user
education, imagine how simple a &#8220;virus&#8221; could be. And how devastating.
Let&#8217;s glance by the fact that Windows has poisoned Linux users. Most
Windows users are used to clicking &#8220;ok&#8221; to everything that pops up. So,
when Linux asks them for a root password to install software, or perform
some other action, the default reaction will probably be to do it. After
all, if the <span class="caps">OS</span> wants it, it should be done. Let&#8217;s not even think of
those Linux distros that totally disregard root and give the user root
privileges - the designers aimed to get rid of the security advantages
of a Unix-like <span class="caps">OS</span>, and did so&nbsp;perfectly.</p>
<p>Surely, Linux security will improve in ways that are easier for novices
to understand. File permissions should be checked by a scrpit, as well
as checksums, system logs, etc. and it can all be tied up in a simple
interface. But, let&#8217;s think about this for a minute. Digg ran an article
at the end of last year claiming 8 Million Ubuntu users. Let&#8217;s say that
only a million of them are complete novices. How many of them, do you
think, would think twice if they got an email or went to a web page
(that looked &#8220;official&#8221;) that asked them to download and run a script in
order to update something. Or just a popular web site that asked them to
download some package or file and run it, in order to be able to view
some content? It&#8217;s only one line in cron to start a DDoS attack. Maybe
two&nbsp;lines.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for Linux moving to the desktop. Paying more for an <span class="caps">OS</span> than you
paid for the computer is just insanity. Paying for any software when
there&#8217;s a prefectly good free alternative isn&#8217;t too smart. And, for the
majority of casual computer users, a Linux-based system would work
perfectly - not to mention the stability and lack of frustration from
BSODs, etc. But before this happens, there needs to be a community
effort to educate new users about security, about the differences
between Linux and Windows (or Mac), and about what is &#8220;bad&#8221; (malicious,
just out of place, etc.). Most of all, there needs to be a concerted
effort to develop all-in-one security tools that monitor logs,
filesystems, system files, installed packages, permissions, etc. and
present them in a simple, user-friendly manner (i.e. this is wrong, the
system thinks it should be this, click for more information or click to
fix it - and, of course, an easy way to rollback changes. ). Perhaps
most important for new users, and ease-of-use, is a way to track these
changes based on what package initiates&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried Linux, give it a shot. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything,
it&#8217;s secure, stable, and fast, it runs on half the machine that Vista
needs, and best of all, it promotes Free Software (&#8220;open source&#8221;) which,
after all, is in the interest of everyone who uses a computer.
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> will even mail you a <span class="caps">CD</span> for free! If
you&#8217;re not ready to give up Windows, download
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>. And, if you&#8217;re already a Linux
guru, have a look at <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> - if
you&#8217;re a developer or a SysAdmin, you&#8217;ll thank me for suggesting it (and
Sun will mail you a free <span class="caps">CD</span> or <span class="caps">DVD</span>, too!). They even have LiveCD Solaris&nbsp;versions.</p>
