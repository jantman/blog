                </div>
                <p>I just purchased four new servers, and set out to find some good asset
management software. Specifically, I&#8217;m looking for a <span class="caps">PHP</span> package that
allows me to track the details of all of my hardware. While software and
configuration tracking would surely be good for some applications, I
already have a package to handle&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I searched a few popular sites, including SourceForge, and came up with
a dozen or so possibilities that looked good. They varied in level of
detail and features, but all had one common failure - they lack an
object-oriented or relational approach. What do I mean by that? Most of
them are designed so that you enter data in a form, it goes into a
database, and exists just as a table of data. Devices, networks, etc.
exist&nbsp;independently.</p>
<p>What do I want? An object-oriented approach that can handle
relationships between objects, and hierarchies. Lets design a few
objects as examples: We&#8217;ll have Networks, Servers, Interfaces, Switches,
Hard Drives, and UPSs. They each represent the real-world hardware. An
interface, for our purposes, will be a physical way of connecting two
devices - an <span class="caps">NIC</span>, serial line,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re experienced in object-oriented programming, you can think of
relationships as inheritance, with an added capability of other&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>Our Server object will represent a real-world server. It has components
(other objects) such as Interfaces, Hard Drives, and&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>How does this all pull&nbsp;together?</p>
<p>We define, in our asset management software, a Server which has one
Interface (Ethernet <span class="caps">NIC</span> called &#8220;<span class="caps">NIC1</span>&#8221;) and three Hard Drives (called
<span class="caps">HDD1</span>-<span class="caps">HDD3</span>). The Interface, in turn belongs to a Network (<span class="caps">LAN</span>/<span class="caps">VLAN</span>), and
has a field called &#8220;connection&#8221; which references a Interface of a Switch
object, specifically Interface &#8220;Port1&#8221; on Switch &#8220;Switch1&#8221;. We&#8217;ll define
one Network called &#8220;<span class="caps">LAN</span>&#8221; which is identified by the 192.168.0 <span class="caps">IP</span> range
(a field of the Network object). We create a Switch object, which
belongs to <span class="caps">LAN</span>, has <span class="caps">IP</span> 192.168.0.2, and has 24 Interfaces, called
&#8220;Port1&#8221; through &#8220;Port24&#8221;. This represents a BayStack 450-24T Ethernet
switch. We&#8217;ll also define a <span class="caps">UPS</span> called &#8220;SmartUPS&#8221;, which in turn has an
Interface which is part of &#8220;<span class="caps">LAN</span>&#8221;, Connected to Switch1 on&nbsp;Port21.</p>
<p>Now, you see the concept beginning to emerge. We have, in essence, an
inter-related mesh of objects representing physical hardware and its&#8217;
properties. This can all be thought of in a three-dimensional form,
which represents the connections and relationships in our&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>The main two advantages of this approach&nbsp;are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to quickly recognize relationships between objects. If,
for example, we looked at a summary page in Switch1, we would see a
number of static fields describing its properties (manufacturer, model,
<span class="caps">IP</span>, <span class="caps">MAC</span>, etc.) as well as a diagram of its&#8217; relationships. Such a
diagram would look something&nbsp;like:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Port1  -&gt; <span class="caps">NIC1</span> -&gt; Server1
Port21 -&gt; SmartSlotCard1 -&gt; <span class="caps">UPS1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It would also have a listing of Networks which this device is a member
of,&nbsp;specifically:</p>
<p><span class="caps">LAN</span></p>
<p>In practice, on a web interface, each one of these entries would be a
link to that object&#8217;s summary. Clicking on <span class="caps">LAN</span>, <span class="caps">UPS1</span>, Server1, etc.
would show us the summary of that object, so that we can browse through
our physical network. Clicking on <span class="caps">LAN</span>, for example, would show <span class="caps">LAN</span>&#8217;s
properties, as well as all devices that are members of <span class="caps">LAN</span> (related to&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>The power of such an approach also relies on binding objects to specific
pieces of hardware. For example, the disk drives in Server1 (<span class="caps">HDD1</span>, <span class="caps">HDD2</span>,
<span class="caps">HDD3</span>) would in turn be references to objects representing actual
physical assets. We can then move these assets around. For example,
let&#8217;s say that we assign a unique serial number of 000306 at a physical
hard drive. We now create an object for it, and reference <span class="caps">HDD3</span> in
Server1 to this object. If we reconfigure Server1 (physically) by
removing <span class="caps">HDD1</span> (000306) and place it on a shelf, we could then edit
Server1&#8217;s <span class="caps">HDD3</span> object to be &#8220;empty&#8221;, and have 000306 reassigned to an
object &#8220;Shelf02&#8221; that represents a physical storage location. By viewing
the summary for Server1, we would see that <span class="caps">HDD3</span> is &#8220;empty&#8221;, but if we
viewed Shelf02, we would see that 000306 is there, waiting to be used.
When we add a server, Server2, we could assign 000306 to that server,
as, say,&nbsp;<span class="caps">HDD2</span>.</p>
<p>To give another example, <span class="caps">UPS1</span> is an uninterruptible power supply. We can
&#8220;assign&#8221; devices to it, such as Switch1 and Server1. Viewing a summary
for <span class="caps">UPS1</span> would show us that Switch1 and Server1 are connected to it.
Similarly, viewing the summary for either Server1 or Switch1 would show
us that they are connected to <span class="caps">UPS1</span>. If we add <span class="caps">UPS2</span>, we could simply edit
the Server1 object so that it is connected to <span class="caps">UPS2</span>, and the <span class="caps">UPS1</span> and
<span class="caps">UPS2</span> objects would show this change&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<ol>
<li>Historical tracking. Every change would be accompanied by a person
responsible, a date and time, a reason, and perhaps other information.
Exactly how this would be implemented is not decided (whether
relationships would be marked as &#8216;deleted&#8217; or whether changes would be
held in a separate table in the database), but the idea is that any
object would also contain a history of relationships. From our previous
examples, if we viewed a summary of Server1, we would see that the
connection to <span class="caps">UPS1</span> was severed on a specific date due to a reason such
as &#8220;overload&#8221; and on that same date, the current connection to <span class="caps">UPS2</span> was
established. Similarly, if we view the summary for <span class="caps">HDD2</span> on Server2, we
would see that the object represents real-world hardware asset #000306.
Viewing the summary for 000306 would show us that it is a 18.2 Gb <span class="caps">SCSI</span>
drive in a Compaq hot-swap tray, and that it was originally installed in
Server1, but moved on a certain date for a certain reason to Shelf02,
and then later moved to&nbsp;Server2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The implementation of this concept would most likely come about as a
web-based <span class="caps">PHP</span> front-end with a MySQL database back-end. In order to
achieve good functionality, there would be a simple interface with quick
execution of common tasks. Most likely, the names I have used such as
Server1, <span class="caps">UPS1</span>, <span class="caps">HDD3</span> on Server1, etc. would just be reference names to a
real-world hardware object, and its&#8217; data object representation,
identified by a unique <span class="caps">ID</span>. For example, the name <span class="caps">HDD3</span> on Server1 would
really just be a reference to 000306, a Hard Drive&nbsp;object.</p>
<p>If we physically removed this drive from Server1 and placed it on
Shelf02, we would browse to the Server1 page in our web interface, and
click on &#8220;<span class="caps">HDD3</span>&#8221;, which would bring us to a page representing 000306. We
could then click on a &#8220;Move&#8221; link, bringing us to a form. This allows us
to enter our name, date and time, reason, etc. and a new location of
&#8220;Shelf02&#8221;. We click submit and the move information is entered into a
table, which references all associated objects - Server1, <span class="caps">HDD3</span> on
Server1, 000306, Shelf02, etc. <span class="caps">HDD3</span> on Server1 has the reference to
000306 removed, and a reference to a History object added. Shelf02 has a
reference to the History object, as well as a reference to 000306,&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>Now, viewing <span class="caps">HDD3</span> on Server1 would show that there is no physical device
associated with it (empty), but would give a reference (link) to the
000306 drive, the History entry for the removal, and the current
location of 000306 on&nbsp;Shelf02.</p>
