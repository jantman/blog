                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><strong>Notice/Disclaimer:</strong> The information I provide on home automation/security and surveillance is based on what I&#8217;ve set up for myself based on a balance of cost, ease of use, and security, and should be considered for hobby purposes only. My current system and code has grown organically over time and is not how I&#8217;d approach this if I started over from scratch. My code and system has a few obvious vulnerabilities and probably some non-obvious ones as well; I humbly but sincerely ask that you do not attempt to exploit these. I highly recommend that anyone implementing a similar system - especially if you also publish the details of it - have undocumented backup systems/devices. Finally, the systems that I describe are intended to provide some protection against or notification of crimes of opportunity, not targeted attacks. Please keep in mind that none of this is intended to protect against someone who targets <em>me</em> specifically (and takes the time to research me) as opposed to my home at random.</div>

<p>It seems that crime is on the rise in the area where I live, and in my &#8220;gated&#8221; (when they actually close)
apartment complex. I&#8217;m going out of town for a while to visit family, and was a bit wary of leaving my
apartment - and all of my posessions, and most importantly my cats, unattended for too long. I&#8217;m having
some family in the area check on the cats every few days, but that doesn&#8217;t do a lot for my peace of mind
in a complex that&#8217;s had a few break-ins this&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played around on previous trips with with <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome">motion</a>, a motion-activated video recording tool,
and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-960-000585-HD-Webcam-C310/dp/B003LVZO8S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450663461&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+c310">Logitech C310 webcam</a>,
but with four cats, it&#8217;s far from a tool to detect a human in my apartment. So, the weekend before my trip,
I decided to do some&nbsp;tinkering.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an &#8220;alarm system&#8221; control panel next to the entry to my apartment, but it appears to be a no-name system that probably
cost $20 and doesn&#8217;t actually do anything other than sound a chime when the door opens. I turned it off the day I moved in,
and hadn&#8217;t given it a second thought since. However, it occurred to me that the useless panel next to the washing machine
probably had magnetic contact switches for the doors. Sure enough, after a few minutes with a multimeter, I found that both
the entry door and the sliding balcony door have normally-closed magnetic contacts wired back to the panel. After thinking
over the options for a few minutes, I remembered that I had a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (the original)
sitting unused under my <span class="caps">TV</span>, and a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11772">PiFace I/O card</a> that I&#8217;d never&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>After about an hour of connecting some wires and playing around with the wonderfully-simple <a href="http://piface.github.io/pifacedigitalio/">pifacedigitalio</a>
Python package <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pifacedigitalio/3.0.5">available on PyPi</a>, I was able to successfully read
inputs for when either door was open. I figured that this would provide the perfect squelch for motion recording from the
webcam, as the cats aren&#8217;t able to operate the deadbolt on my front door (I had to replace all of the interior door handles
with cat-proof&nbsp;models).</p>

<p>The system that I&#8217;ve come up with is rather rough around the edges&#8230; to put it lightly. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that it was written
in a few days, and at this point, it&#8217;s not really intended to be used by anyone who doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of the
components (and Python). But I&#8217;m hoping that someone else might find it interesting, or perhaps improve on it. It&#8217;s not terribly
robust, but it seems to be working acceptably well for my&nbsp;needs.</p>
<h2 id="components"><a class="toclink" href="#components">Components</a></h2>
<p>The system is split into a number of components, with some of them running on the Raspberry Pi and some on my desktop&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>The Pi is running my <a href="https://github.com/jantman/piface-webhooks">piface-webhooks</a> project (everything needed to set it up on
<a href="https://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian</a> or <a href="https://osmc.tv/"><span class="caps">OSMC</span></a> is available in the repo), which is made up of two Python&nbsp;services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>piface-listener</strong> Is the code that actually polls the PiFace inputs. When the state of an input changes, it writes out
a file (under <code>/var/spool/piface-webhooks</code> by default) with the input number, state, and&nbsp;timestamp.</li>
<li><strong>piface-worker</strong> Polls this directory for files; when one is found, it takes some action and then removes the file. The
current actions are sending an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> webhook, sending a message via <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a>, and sending an email
via Gmail. I currently use all of these, mainly for redudnancy. The webhook feature is used to <span class="caps">POST</span> data to <code>motion_piface_handler.py</code>,
a Flask app running on my&nbsp;desktop.</li>
</ul>
<p>My desktop computer is the heart of the system, handling the webcam and most of the &#8220;alarm&#8221;&nbsp;logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome">motion</a> monitors the webcam feed for motion above a certain number of
pixels. When motion is detected, it saves both <span class="caps">JPEG</span> images and <span class="caps">AVI</span> files to disk, logs the event in a MySQL database, and
executes a Python script. It also saves a snapshot from the webcam every 30&nbsp;seconds.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/s3sync_inotify.py">s3sync_inotify.py</a> is a quick Python script I wrote that
uses Linux inotify to monitor <code>motion</code>&#8216;s output directory for new files (only when they&#8217;ve been closed, and are finished being
written) and syncs them to an S3 bucket set up for static website hosting. It also generates an <code>index.html</code> file for the bucket,
with links to all uploaded files. At startup, any files that aren&#8217;t yet synced are uploaded, so it <em>should</em> handle crashes relatively&nbsp;well.</li>
<li><strong>handle_motion.py</strong> is the command executed by <code>motion</code> when an event is detected; it POSTs data to <code>motion_piface_handler.py</code>.</li>
<li><strong>motion_piface_handler.py</strong> is the heart of the system, explained&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motion_piface_handlerpy-pulling-it-all-together"><a class="toclink" href="#motion_piface_handlerpy-pulling-it-all-together">motion_piface_handler.py - Pulling it all&nbsp;together</a></h2>
<p>Webhooks from both the Raspberry Pi door sensor and <code>motion</code>&#8216;s command execution go to a Python <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> app
running on my desktop. This app accepts the incoming data, and also connects to the MySQL database used by Motion. When a <span class="caps">POST</span> from
<code>piface-worker</code> comes in showing that a door has been opened, it adds a record to the MySQL database with information on the input
pin (which door) and state (open/closed), and&nbsp;timestamp.</p>
<p>When a <span class="caps">POST</span> comes in from <code>handle_motion.py</code>, the command executed by <code>motion</code> when a file is written, the app checks to see if
a door has been opened in the past few minutes. If not, the event is ignored (and logged, of course). However, if a door has been
opened, the real fun starts. First, the database is queried for the last time a notification was sent out. If one has been sent
in the past few minutes, the current event is ignored (and a rate-limiting message is logged). If it hasn&#8217;t sent out a message
recently, the database is queried for the last door event (which door, and if it was opened or closed) as well as the last <span class="caps">AVI</span>
and last five JPEGs saved by <code>motion</code>. This information is all formatted into a message and sent to my GMail account, and a
shortened version (with just the door event information, and that motion was detected) is sent to my phone via Pushover, with
the highest priority and a custom notification&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p>So far - at least as far as taking my dogs out is concerned - it appears to be working relatively well. There&#8217;s a bit of
latency in the S3 uploads, especially when AVIs are written, so the files linked in the notification emails may not be
uploaded before the message goes out. That&#8217;s a bit annying, but something that I think I can live&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>The use of disk queueing probably isn&#8217;t the best, especially with the Pi&#8217;s <span class="caps">SD</span> card, but I wanted something that was simple
and didn&#8217;t introduce any additional service dependencies. Each of the components runs as a systemd service, configured to
always restart, so it should tolerate internal failures relatively well. The Python code has a <em>lot</em> of bare excepts;
I&#8217;m not sure this was the right way to approach it, but my initial theory was that in the event of an error, I&#8217;m more
concerned about keeping the system running than getting an individual message through. The point of the system is to let
me know if my home - and more importantly, my four-legged children - are in danger. I figured that I&#8217;d rather get a delayed
notification than none at&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a class="toclink" href="#results">Results</a></h2>
<p>After two weeks away, the system worked quite well. It triggered correctly, and quickly, when my family came to check on the cats.
On average, it took about 3-5 seconds for me to receive the PushOver and GMail notifications for a door open event, and about 30 seconds
for an alarm (motion after door state change)&nbsp;event.</p>
<p>However, I did have a few&nbsp;issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Late one night, I got a door open alert when I hadn&#8217;t been expecting anyone. After about half an hour of panic checking the webcam feed
and watching the logs remotely, I determined that it was a false positive. All was well, there wasn&#8217;t any sign of anyone in the apartment,
the cats were all wandering (or lounging) around as normal, and the door never registered as closed. A day or two later, the door registered
as closing. I&#8217;m not sure if this was an issue with the door sensor triggering because of wind or vibration, or an issue with the PiFace itself
having internal issues reading an input over such a long time, or something with induced current in the long unshielded sensor wire in the wall
(and possibly compounded by my naive debounce&nbsp;logic).</li>
<li>Having <code>motion</code> store everything in one directory, and then <code>s3sync_inotify.py</code> sync that to S3 and create an <code>index.html</code> file was a
bad idea. <code>motion</code> was triggered quite often by the cats; after about a week away, I had ~<span class="caps">10GB</span> of photos and videos in the S3 bucket, and the
<code>index.html</code> file was over <span class="caps">7MB</span>. Not only did the index page take a painfully long amount of time to load, but generation of it introduced enough
latency in the upload process that <code>s3sync_inotify.py</code> ended up missing a large number of&nbsp;files.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="next-steps"><a class="toclink" href="#next-steps">Next&nbsp;Steps</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll do much more work on this - we don&#8217;t travel often - but if I do, the next things that I want to tackle&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queueing of outgoing messages, so that network outages won&#8217;t result in completely-lost&nbsp;communication.</li>
<li>Some sort of heartbeat - ideally to an off-premesis system, such as my <span class="caps">EC2</span> instance - from every process involved, to
confirm that all of the components (a) are running correctly, and (b) have&nbsp;connectivity.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>motion</code> output directory structure and <code>s3sync_inotify.py</code> to write into per-day (or per-hour) directories
and write <code>index.html</code> files for each of&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>See if there&#8217;s a straightforward way to use systemd&#8217;s <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html">sd_notify</a>
from Python, to build a watchdog into the processes and have systemd restart them if they&nbsp;hang.</li>
<li>Packaging this all together into one or more real repositories, so maybe it can be used by&nbsp;others.</li>
<li>Cleaning up <code>handle_motion.py</code> and <code>motion_piface_handler.py</code> and releasing them along with everything&nbsp;else.</li>
