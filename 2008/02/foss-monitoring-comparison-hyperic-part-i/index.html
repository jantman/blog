                <p>So, I&#8217;ve made some headway on the comparison. I have Hyperic installed
and partly configured, albeit without email alerts yet. I&#8217;ve found some
serious features that I need missing, but I&#8217;m going to give it a full
run before I move on to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>The full text, updated a few times a day, is available on <a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Network_Monitoring_Comparison">my
wiki</a>.
Here&#8217;s a bit of an&nbsp;excerpt:  </p>
<h3 id="part-i-installation"><a class="toclink" href="#part-i-installation">Part I -&nbsp;Installation</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>setup Xen virtual machine running OpenSuSE 10.3 base packages. (3
    hours, some server problems, some Xen problems, and some time
    learning Xen administration from the&nbsp;<span class="caps">CLI</span>)</li>
<li>Download <code>hyperic-hq-installer-3.2.0-607-x86-linux.tgz</code> from
    <a href="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html" title="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html">Hyperic</a>
    and&nbsp;extract.</li>
<li>Browse to
    <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide">http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/<span class="caps">DOC</span>/Full+Installation+Guide</a></li>
<li>
<p><code>cd</code> into <code>hyperic-hq-installer</code> and run <code>./setup.sh -full</code></p>
<ol>
<li>The installation can&#8217;t be run as root (though I assumed it would
    need root&nbsp;privileges).</li>
<li>I selected to install all 3 components - Server, Shell, and&nbsp;Agent.</li>
<li>Well, whoops! Sorta stupid to not allow installation as root,
    when the default location to install to is <code>/home/hyperic</code>. How
    do they expect an arbitrary user to install there? Even worse,
    it appears that the default OpenSuSE 10.3 installation doesn&#8217;t
    come with <code>sudo</code> (!!!!) so I can&#8217;t try&nbsp;that.</li>
<li>As root, create <code>/home/hyperic</code> and chown to my&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Repear the above steps (well, hopefully not all of&nbsp;them).</li>
<li>Default ports for everything - web <span class="caps">GUI</span> on 7080, <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> web <span class="caps">GUI</span> on
    7443, jnp service on 2099, mbean server on&nbsp;9093,</li>
<li>Change domain names in default URLs to logical ones for my test
    environment (no real <span class="caps">DNS</span>, just IPcop hosts, so
    devel-hyperic1.localdomian). I hope that I can change these
    later, or even better that absolute paths aren&#8217;t used too much,
    as this will screw with my idea of using <span class="caps">SSH</span> port forwarding for
    remote&nbsp;access.</li>
<li>Leave the default <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server alone and change it later - I
    odn&#8217;t even have mail running here at the&nbsp;apartment.</li>
<li>Use the built-in PostgreSQL database with default port of&nbsp;9432.</li>
<li>Go with the defaults for everything after&nbsp;this.</li>
<li>Everything runs nicely, and then it tells you to login to
    another terminal as root and run a script. I&#8217;m not sure I like
    this method, but I guess it works. Login and do&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>How will it start the builtin database? As my user???? Yup.
    postgres is running as my user. Wonderful. Nothing in the
    <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide">install
    document</a>
    mentioned user creation. Was this just assumed? Because in the
    naive world I live in, most installer scripts (think Nagios)
    create a user for you, or tell you&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>Setup script complete. A few instructions&nbsp;follow&#8230;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>/home/hyperic/server-3.2.0/bin/hq-server.sh start</code>&#8230; as my
    user. <em>Note to self:</em> setup a user for Postgres and Hyperic. Believe
    it or not, but it booted - but followed with the message, &#8220;Login to
    <span class="caps">HQ</span> at:
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7080/" title="http://127.0.0.1:7080/">http://127.0.0.1:7080/</a>&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>Browsed to
    <a href="http://devel-hyperic1:7080/" title="http://devel-hyperic1:7080">http://devel-hyperic1:7080</a>
    and was greeted by a startup page, saying that the server was 18%
    finished booting. My, I yearn for little C binaries and a <span class="caps">PHP</span>&nbsp;frontend.</li>
<li>Page turns blank and stops there. I refresh, and get a login page. I
    enter my username and password, and get a little message box where
    the &#8220;invalid password&#8221; box usually is - says &#8220;Server is still
    booting&#8221;. This is over a minute later. I&#8217;m happy to see
    Apache/Coyote1.1, but would like to be able to get into Hyperic in
    less time than it takes the machine to boot to a graphical login
    screen (ok, granted, I&#8217;m running <span class="caps">XFCE</span>). In SuSE&#8217;s YaST Xen Monitor,
    I see that the <span class="caps">VM</span> is at 45% of its&#8217; <span class="caps">464MB</span> <span class="caps">RAM</span>, and 90% <span class="caps">CPU</span> - with
    8.5% consumed by&nbsp;dom0.</li>
<li><span class="caps">CPU</span> usage for the <span class="caps">VM</span> drops to 1% and I login again. <span class="caps">BAM</span>! Hyperic <span class="caps">HQ</span>.
    Aside from the fact that it shows <span class="caps">NO</span> resources&#8230; oh&#8230; start the&nbsp;Agent.</li>
<li>Start the Agent on the <span class="caps">VM</span> running Hyperic. It asks me for the server
    <span class="caps">IP</span> address. What, no <span class="caps">DNS</span>? I enter the <span class="caps">IP</span> as it is&#8230; for now. I keep
    everything at defaults, including using the hqadmin username and
    password. Successfully&nbsp;started.</li>
<li><span class="caps">BAM</span>! In Dashboard, I see the auto-discovered host with the right
    hostname, as well as Tomcat, Agent, JBoss, and PostgreSQL. Amazing!
    Click &#8220;Add to&nbsp;Inventory&#8221;.</li>
<li>Check out the &#8220;Resources&#8221; -> &#8220;Browse&#8221; screen. It knows this machine
    is OpenSuSE 10.3, and I see my four services (listed above). Of
    course, no metrics yet, but I see the correct <span class="caps">IP</span>, gateway, <span class="caps">DNS</span>,
    vendor (SuSE), kernel version, <span class="caps">RAM</span>, architecture, and <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;speed.</li>
<li>Looking through the &#8220;Inventory&#8221; screen, I see everything - NICs and
    MACs, running servers and one service (a <span class="caps">CPU</span> resource). What more
    could a man want in&#8230;let&#8217;s see.. just over an&nbsp;hour!</li>
<li>I really *love* the &#8220;Views&#8221; screen which, even out-of-the-box,
    allows &#8220;Live Exec&#8221; information from cpuinfo, df, ifconfig, netstat,
    top, who, and&nbsp;more.</li>
<li>Well, it&#8217;s 03:35, and I have work and class tomorrow. I think it&#8217;s
    time to give Part I a rest. But&nbsp;first&#8230;</li>
<li>Go to the &#8220;Platform&#8221; page for my one machine and&#8230; <span class="caps">YES</span>! Graphs are
    starting to&nbsp;appear!</li>
<li>Following the suggestion
    <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/HQ+Quick+Start#HQQuickStart-enableTracking" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/HQ+Quick+Start#HQQuickStart-enableTracking">here</a>,
    I enable log and config tracking on the platform for <code>/var/log/warn</code>
    and <code>/etc/hosts</code>,&nbsp;respecitvely.</li>
<li>Before I call it a night (now 03:42), I stop back at the <a href="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html" title="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html">downloads
    page</a>
    and grab the Linux x86 Agent for the dom0 machine, hoping to get
    some physical information as well. While I&#8217;m at it, I grab the Linux
    <span class="caps">AMD64</span> Agent to try on my laptop. I create &#8220;hyperic&#8221; users on each
    system. On the base Xen server, I give it a shot and get &#8220;Unable to
    register agent: Error communicating with agent: Unauthorized&#8221;. Same
    thing on the&nbsp;laptop.</li>
<li>Did a little reading
    <a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Installation+Non-Windows#InstallationNon-Windows-install" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Installation+Non-Windows#InstallationNon-Windows-install">here</a>.
    As to keeping all of the defaults, it turns out that both clients
    had firewalls blocking <span class="caps">TCP</span> port 2144. I opened it up on both, and
    also set the <span class="caps">IP</span> address (that the server uses to contact the client)
    to the correct ones. Viola! Now I have 3 clients connected, and
    gatheirng data for the next \~16 hours until I have time to check it
    out&nbsp;agian.</li>
</ol>
<p>More to come in Part <span class="caps">II</span> tomorrow - actually doing something with
Hyperic. For<br>
now (04:08), time to&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<h3 id="part-ii-configuration"><a class="toclink" href="#part-ii-configuration">Part <span class="caps">II</span> -&nbsp;Configuration</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t had much time to play with Hyperic in the two
days<br>
since installation. The most I&#8217;ve really done is setup Agents on my
laptop,<br>
desktop, and the host machine (both dom0 and domU for Hyperic), so that
they<br>
start to collect&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>While I found a lot of upsetting stuff in the features list (see below),
I<br>
decided to go ahead and add some other devices. On the network at the<br>
apartment, I have two manageable switches (a Linksys and a 3Com) - which
pretty<br>
much make up the sum of non-host equipment. I also have an IPcop box,
though I<br>
assume the standard Linux Agent will handle that. The one item missing
that I<br>
have at home is my set of <span class="caps">APC</span> SmartUPS UPSs with <span class="caps">SNMP</span> cards, but I guess
I&#8217;ll<br>
just have to skip them for this&nbsp;review.</p>
<p>First, I went in and added a platform (Resources->Browse, Tools
Menu->Add<br>
Platform) for the 3Com switch (a SuperStack <span class="caps">II</span> Switch 3300). It showed<br>
successful creation - but nothing else. I went in and entered the <span class="caps">SNMP</span><br>
community string, <span class="caps">IP</span>, and version (1). In about a minute or so, I
started to<br>
see metrics - Availability, <span class="caps">IP</span> Forwards, <span class="caps">IP</span> In Receives, an <span class="caps">IP</span> In
Received per<br>
Second. While it&#8217;s quite basic, that&#8217;s good for a starting point. While
the<br>
[<a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOCSHQ30/Network+Device+platform" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOCSHQ30/Network+Device+platform">http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/<span class="caps">DOCSHQ30</span>/Network+Device+platform</a><br>
Network Device Platform] documentation lists lots of metrics that can
be<br>
enabled, I&#8217;d also like telnet availability and - my big one since I use
a<br>
&#8220;cute&#8221; (crappy) IPcop installation for local <span class="caps">DNS</span>, a dig on <span class="caps">DNS</span> to make
sure<br>
the entry is there. In the Monitor screen, I was able to enable a bunch
of<br>
additional metrics (by clicking on the &#8220;Show All Metrics&#8221; link), though<br>
there&#8217;s also no way (that I can find) to monitor the status of
individual<br>&nbsp;ports.</p>
<p>Next, I browsed through the &#8220;Administration&#8221; pages, setup a few users,
and<br>
started setting *way* more default metrics for various platforms,
services,<br>
and servers. While I don&#8217;t have mail running yet, that will come this<br>
weekend. While I added a lot of things as &#8220;Default On&#8221;, I still need to
go<br>
back and add more things in the templates as&nbsp;Indicators.</p>
<p>I also added some escalations, though they&#8217;re quite simple - you can
notify <span class="caps">HQ</span><br>
users or &#8220;other users&#8221; by email or <span class="caps">SMS</span>, write to SysLog, or suppress
alerts<br>
for 0 minutes to 24 hours. Hopefully I&#8217;ll also find a plugin for
Asterisk<br>
integration. One striking omission is user groups. Also, the concept of<br>
&#8220;Roles&#8221; (maybe their idea of groups?) is only available in the
Enterprise<br>&nbsp;version.</p>
<p>At this point, I also notice one other majoe issue, though perhaps I&#8217;ll
find a<br>
solution in my experimentation - there doesn&#8217;t be a way to setup
default<br>
alerts for metrics. If they have all of this platform, server, and
service<br>
information defined as default templates, why not just have a way to
assign<br>
default users (and groups) to these objects, and have default alerts<br>&nbsp;generated?</p>
<p>In terms of Apache 2.2 monitoring, out-of-the-box, nothing worked. No
metrics<br>
at all. Firstly, Hyperic requires the mod_status module. Persoanlly,
I&#8217;d<br>
rather handle all of that through a backend, like Nagios. Secondly, it
got the<br>
pidfile and apache2ctl paths wrong. Furthermore, it has no &#8220;smart&#8221;
checking for resources - while my Apache 2.2 resource config was clearly
wrong (wrong <span class="caps">PID</span> file path, no mod_status), Hyperic didn&#8217;t detect this
and was showing the resource as&nbsp;&#8220;Down&#8221;.</p>
<p>After that, I setup a bunch of alerts for things that I thought would be
off-kilter a lot (like <span class="caps">WARN</span> log entries on my laptop, high memory usage
on some stressed machines, etc.) as well as log and config file
monitoring and alerts for them. While I didn&#8217;t have mail working yet, I
figured I might as well get that stuff&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>On the Xen dom0 host that runs the Hyperic vm (box called xenmaster1), I
wasn&#8217;t able to add config file tracking for any of the /etc/xen/ files.
At this point I notice some serious shortcomings - not only is it not
possible to define a template of alerts for a given
platform/server/service, it&#8217;s also impossible to define a template for
alerts. I also noticed that it&#8217;s not possible to define groups of
contacts. This wasn&#8217;t much of a problem for my test installation - the
alerts are only going to my roommate and I - but it would surely be an
issue in any larger&nbsp;setting.</p>
<p>At this point in configuration, I come to a make-or-break point. With
some of these shortcomings, I really need a way to call a script with
alert information when an alert is generated - whether it&#8217;s to dial out
through Asterisk or just automatically create a ticket for the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>Adding alerts is a cumbersome process. You have to browse to a page for
a specific metric - which means going to the page for a specific
platform, server, or service - and then opening the page for that
metric. The actual alert creation takes up two pages - one for the
metric, threshold, and time-based criteria, and a second for who to
alert. This means that to add alerts for a machine, you need to view the
platform page as well as the services and servers pages, and each metric&nbsp;therein.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting some more in the days to come. From a <a href="http://forums.hyperic.com/jiveforums/thread.jspa?messageID=14561&amp;#14561">post at the
Hyperic
Forums</a>,
I was able to find out that a Xen plugin is in the works, but for the
Open Source version, the only way to trigger a script is to send an
email and have it handled by a filter such as&nbsp;Procmail.</p>
