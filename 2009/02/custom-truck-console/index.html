                <p>I&#8217;ll keep this post relatively to the point (the original full story is
on <a href="http://www.elightbars.org">eLightbars.org</a>
<a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb//topic401009.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb/post59822.html">here</a>). My 2006 Ford F-250
<span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">XLT</span> was stolen in September, 2008. It was recovered about a month
later, after Geico said they&#8217;d pay out, and after I&#8217;d bought another
vehicle. Anyway, it came back from the body shop about 2 months later,
and it was time to begin customizing it again. The main parts of the
project were wiring and installation and building a custom&nbsp;console&#8230;</p>
<p>My main inspiration was some of the custom consoles done by places like
<a href="http://www.odysseyauto.com/">Odyssey</a>, though I wanted something
carpeted (hopefully a close match to the factory interior). The main
idea I was working off of was this one from&nbsp;Odyssey:  </p>
<p><img alt="Odyssey Excursion
console" src="http://www.odysseyauto.com/cabinets/Images/cabpics/excurcon-lg.jpg"></p>
<p>The general idea was to have a replacement for the factory console which
would allow mounting of a radio, emergency lighting controls, and a few
other things while not sacrificing storage space. The specific
requirements that I came up with&nbsp;included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mount over the transmission hump more or less where the factory
    console is, forward to the&nbsp;dash.</li>
<li>Allow access to the pull-out cupholders in the dash and not impede
    access to any&nbsp;controls.</li>
<li>Fasten to the floor using only the four factory console&nbsp;bolts.</li>
<li>Allow mounting of at least one radio, one switch box, <span class="caps">GPS</span> and&nbsp;scanner.</li>
<li>Radio and switch box should be mounted using the <a href="http://www.jottodesk.com/">Jotto
    Desk</a> faceplates that I had from the <span class="caps">CVPI</span>&nbsp;console.</li>
<li><em>The real clincher that prevented me from using a stock console:</em> Have a large storage
    compartment comparable to the factory&nbsp;console.</li>
<li>Provide a set of rear&nbsp;cupholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent some time over the course of three days or so measuring the
console area of the truck and drawing out my initial plan in <span class="caps">CAD</span>
(specifically the demo version of <a href="http://www.qcad.org/qcad.html"><span class="caps">QCAD</span></a>
for Linux - regrettably not Free software). Once I had the plans drawn
up and was satisfied that the angles and measurements were within
acceptable tolerance, I made a full-scale prototype out of foam core
board. With a little shaving of the corners, I managed to get a
relatively good form and transferred it to ½&#8221; cabinet-grade luan
plywood. It was a bit difficult with only a jigsaw, but worked out
relatively well. While I can&#8217;t seem to find any pictures of the foam
core, here are some of the wood form being assembled and the test fit in
the&nbsp;truck:</p>
<p><img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console2-small.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console1-small.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console3-small.jpg"></p>
<p>I&#8217;d originally been a bit worried about the structural integrity, but I
found that by clamping the corners, pre-drilling and securing them with
aggressive wood screws at approximately 1 screw per 1.5 inches along the
joints, the plywood held together&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>After testing the fit and checking that the four factory bolt holes
lined up correctly (which they did, and also held the console quite
securely), I pulled it back out and started the process of carpeting it.
I bought 2 yards (76 x 72 inch) of color #8078 &#8220;Dark Grey/Quartz&#8221; plush
cut pile automotive carpet from
<a href="http://www.stockinteriors.com/">StockInteriors.com</a>, for about $80 with
shipping. It turns out that the color isn&#8217;t an exact match to the
factory carpet (I got 6 sample squares from them and this was the
closest color) but it&#8217;s a good medium between the carpet and&nbsp;upholstery.</p>
<p>Planning for how to cover this wooden behemoth with carpet took quite a
few hours, and short of making it into a week-long job of sewing, I
decided to wrap the sides and back with one piece, folded over on the
bottom and top edges of the storage box, then use separate pieces for
the top of the console and the front (which would be adjacent to the
dash and mostly hidden from view). I started off with a plan to use <a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/">3M
Super
90</a>
spray adhesive, on the advice of an <a href="http://www.elightbars.org"><span class="caps">ELB</span></a>
member. Unfortunately, I could only find <a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/">Super
77</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to carpeting, I had to get the equipment mounting openings down to
about 8.5&#8221; for the 8.75&#8221; Jotto faceplates. I cut some excess luan
plywood down into 2&#8221; wide strips and then cut them to length for the
openings, sandwiching about three together with <a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=42">Liquid
Nails</a> and
then mounted them vertically on the sides of the&nbsp;console.</p>
<p>Carpeting the console at 2 <span class="caps">AM</span> probably wasn&#8217;t the best idea. I looked at
how the cut edges of the carpet would meet and the corners, and decided
I&#8217;d need some sort of edge molding to make it look good - preferably
black powder coated aluminum, somewhere around ½&#8221; legs. As such, I
decided to forgo most of the glue and stapled the carpet at the edges,
planning to cover it with molding. Ok, I lose a few points for that one.
The last thing to go on was the carpet on the front and top, which I
glued with Super 77 and also stapled on the front (where it can&#8217;t be
seen). I cut X-shapes in the mounting areas and folded the carpet down,
stapling it to the inside of the console, and cut a slit in the front
for wiring. The glue didn&#8217;t seem to hold on the narrow parts of the
top/mounting area, but once faceplates were screwed in it was fine. The
faceplates are just held in with screws into the vertical wood strips
placed on the sides of the&nbsp;opening.</p>
<p>Top view of the console, mounted in place, with the unfinished storage&nbsp;box.</p>

<p>Factory cupholders extended with just enough clearance to&nbsp;work:</p>
<p><img alt="factory cupholders open, barely" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0045_small.jpg"></p>
<p>Staples around the edges, intended to be covered with molding. They&#8217;re
really not that visible unless you make a point of looking at them
(given their placement). Red handle is a 100A cutoff for the main
battery lead, with a removable&nbsp;handle.</p>

<p><strong>The weekend after console fabrication, I started wiring. Here&#8217;s the
relevant parts involving the&nbsp;console.</strong></p>

<p>Still to be&nbsp;done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the wiring and&nbsp;installation.</li>
<li>Lining the storage box with something, probably toolbox drawer&nbsp;liner.</li>
<li>Making a cover/lid for the storage&nbsp;box.</li>
