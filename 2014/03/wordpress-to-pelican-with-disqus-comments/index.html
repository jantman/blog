                <p>This is the second part of my WordPress to <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> conversion saga.
In the <a href="/2014/03/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/">last post</a> I ran through some
of the issues that I faced when converting the posts themselves, setting up my theme and settings,
etc. In this post, I&#8217;ll discuss the saga of moving from WordPress comments to Disqus&nbsp;comments.</p>
<p>Be sure to read <strong>all</strong> of this before trying it yourself, as I had some serious problems with my
first&nbsp;attempt.</p>
<h2 id="initial-import-to-disqus"><a class="toclink" href="#initial-import-to-disqus">Initial Import to&nbsp;Disqus</a></h2>
<p>Initially, I installed the Disqus WordPress plugin as instructed in
<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress">Disqus&#8217; Import from WordPress documentation</a>.
The automatic import imported three of 134 comments, and froze there,
even though the status said it was 100% complete. I emailed Disqus&#8217; support,
and was told that this meant the import failed (even though there was no explicit
notification, their admin <span class="caps">UI</span> said the import was successful) and I had to manually
import my comments. I did this, as instructed in the same docs, by disabling all
plugins except for Disqus and generating an <span class="caps">XML</span> export from WordPress, then re-enabling
the plugins, and uploading the export to Disqus. This time, I ended up with all 134
comments in Disqus, so I assumed that all went&nbsp;well.</p>
<h2 id="previewing-comments-in-pelican"><a class="toclink" href="#previewing-comments-in-pelican">Previewing Comments in&nbsp;Pelican</a></h2>
<p>I added my Disqus <code>shortname</code> to the <code>DISQUS_SITENAME</code> field in <code>pelicanconf.py</code> and
re-built. I ended up having an issue with <code>SITE_URL</code> being set incorrectly for some testing
that I did, so that killed 10 minutes. I rebuilt locally with <code>SITE_URL</code> not defined, and
then used <code>fab serve</code> to serve locally. I was using my
<a href="/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/">Planning Migration from Wordpress to Static Site</a>
post to test, as it was both the most recent post, and had a five comments in WordPress, which imported
correctly into Disqus and were visible both in the Disqus moderation tool and on the now-Disqus-powered
WordPress&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Once I rebuilt with <code>DISQUS_SITENAME</code> set and served locally with SimpleHTTPServer (<code>fab serve</code>),
I checked the post and saw only a &#8220;We were unable to load Disqus&#8221; message below the post. It contained
a <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22">link to their help article for that problem</a>,
which pointed me at a domain mismatch/different origin problem. As indicated on that page,
I went to Settings -&gt; Advanced in the Disqus admin, found the &#8220;Trusted Domains&#8221; box, and added
both my test domain (newblog.jasonantman.com - pointing at GitHub pages until I was ready to
shut WordPress down and actually move the live site) and &#8220;localhost&#8221; for testing, and&nbsp;saved.</p>
<p>I refreshed the page I was looking at, and now could see the Disqus commenting below my post,
but it wasn&#8217;t showing any of the comments&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p><img alt="Disqus commenting with no comments" src="/GFX/disqus_wrong_url.png"></p>
<p>I pulled up the source of the page, and saw in the Disqus javascript just below the post&nbsp;content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>            <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_shortname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;jasonantman&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// required: replace example with your forum shortname</span>
            <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_identifier</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
            <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;../../../2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Everything looked <span class="caps">OK</span> to me except for <code>disqus_url</code>, which I&#8217;d seen mention of on the
<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22">help page</a>
I&#8217;d just been looking at. Sure enough, it indicated that the <code>disqus_url</code> var must be
an absolute <span class="caps">URL</span> to the post, not a relative path. I assume this was because I&#8217;d generated
the content without having <code>SITE_URL</code> set, so I hand-edited the generated page to change this
to the correct <span class="caps">URL</span>, http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/,
and tested again. Unfortunately, still zero&nbsp;comments.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress-disqus-plugin-permalinks"><a class="toclink" href="#wordpress-disqus-plugin-permalinks">WordPress Disqus Plugin&nbsp;Permalinks</a></h2>
<p>Fearing the worst, I pulled up the same post on my now-Disqus-powered WordPress blog,
and took a peek at the source. The javascript over there revealed a&nbsp;problem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_identifier</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1546 http://blog.jasonantman.com/?p=1546&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_container_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;disqus_thread&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_domain</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;disqus.com&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_shortname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;jasonantman&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">disqus_title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>While the <span class="caps">URL</span> is correct, the Disqus WordPress plugin uses the WordPress
post <span class="caps">ID</span> and permalink for the &#8220;identifier&#8221;, but the Pelican plugin uses the slug.
That&#8217;s a problem, as my Pelican site will have the same URLs, but the WordPress
post-<span class="caps">ID</span>-based permalinks are gone (since it&#8217;s a static site, and there&#8217;s no easy
way of replicating things that are query param based). The WordPress post IDs
are thrown out by Pelican, so there&#8217;s no way to connect the&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>Even worse, I remembered that Disqus&#8217;
<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress">Importing Comments from WordPress help page</a>
clearly&nbsp;stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imported comments can&#8217;t be permanently deleted. Consider following our <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1053796-best-practices-for-staging-development-and-preview-sites">guidelines for development sites</a> to make sure the data you&#8217;re importing is correct. You can <a href="http://disqus.com/register">register a new forum</a> if you have imported the wrong&nbsp;comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="solution-to-permalink-issue"><a class="toclink" href="#solution-to-permalink-issue">Solution to Permalink&nbsp;Issue</a></h2>
<p>Not seeing any way around it, I figured it was time to &#8220;bite the bullet&#8221;. I disabled the Disqus plugin
in WordPress and then installed and activated the
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/code-freeze/">WordPress Code Freeze Plugin</a>
to disable comments. (<em>Note</em> ironically, this plugin also uses JavaScript to disable your ability to
deactivate plugins, including itself. So before you activate it, copy the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link and save it
somewhere; changing <code>action=activate</code> to <code>action=deactivate</code> will let you get rid of it if you&nbsp;want).</p>
<p>Disqus has some documentation on <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1104797-importing-exporting">Importing and Exporting</a>
which includes <a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150">Custom <span class="caps">XML</span> Imports</a> based on the
WordPress <span class="caps">XML</span> export format. So, I figured that I just had to decide that WordPress commenting would be
turned off, and do a point-in-time migration to Disqus (maybe circling back to hack the Disqus <span class="caps">WP</span> plugin
to keep comments working there for the time&nbsp;being).</p>
<p>Before anything else, I decided to actually set up a test forum/site in Disqus like they suggested.
I updated the <code>DISQUS_SITENAME</code> in <code>pelicanconf.py</code>, and then started in on the <span class="caps">XML</span> munging. The
<a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150">Custom <span class="caps">XML</span> Imports</a> documentation implies
that the import engine recognizes a <code>dsq:thread_identifier</code> <span class="caps">XML</span> element that holds the thread identifier,
but that element wasn&#8217;t present in my WordPress <span class="caps">XML</span> export. It appeared that Disqus was concatenating the
<code>wp:post_id</code> and <code>guid</code> fields (with a space in between) to come up with the&nbsp;identifier.</p>
<p>So, I wrote a script (<a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/dev/wp-move/wp_comment_xml_munge.py">wp_comment_xml_munge.py</a>)
using <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a> that adds the <code>dsq:</code> namespace to the WordPress <span class="caps">XML</span> export (unfortunately using
string replacement and a temp file, due to a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/555602">bug in lxml</a>)
and then adds the <code>dsq:thread_identifier</code> tag to each post item, setting its value to the same
string as <code>wp:post_name</code>, the <span class="caps">URL</span> slug (and post identifier in&nbsp;Pelican).</p>
<p>I imported the <span class="caps">XML</span> written by the script into my test forum in Disqus and rebuilt the Pelican content.
Magically, the first time I looked, the comments were&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Now, time to see if I could get the same effect with the existing Disqus&nbsp;site/forum:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Disqus moderation interface, delete all comments. You&#8217;ll have to do this in batches of 10, as that&#8217;s
   how they&#8217;re paged in the interface. The comments don&#8217;t seem to be permanently deleted, but do show as&nbsp;&#8220;deleted&#8221;.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://import.disqus.com">import.disqus.com</a> and select your &#8220;forum&#8221; (site). You should see your existing
   (previous) import, as 100% complete, with the correct count of threads and comments. Do another import with the
   <code>_disqus.xml</code> munged <span class="caps">XML</span>&nbsp;export.</li>
<li>Comments should now be linked to the correct post in&nbsp;Pelican.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, Pelican seemed to be working, but WordPress was still left with only the old internal commenting,
and that was disabled by the Code Freeze plugin. I probably could have manually patched the Disqus plugin to
reflect the new thread identifiers, but instead, I chose to just push forward with the switch from WordPress to&nbsp;Pelican.</p>
<p>That only took a few hours, and I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;m now up and running with a Pelican blog, hosted for free
by GitHub&nbsp;Pages.</p>
